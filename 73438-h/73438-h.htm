</div>

<p class='c009'>Locomotion, profitless and often
aimless, is, in the opinion of Continentals,
a condition of an Englishman’s
existence. Provided with a
dressing-case that would contain a
Frenchman’s entire wardrobe, and
with a hat-box full of pills “to be
taken at bedtime,” every son of
Albion is supposed to perform, at some
period of his life, a distant journey,
with the sole apparent object of acquiring
a right to say that he has
been “there and back again.” An
Englishman, in the opinion of Europe,
would be a miserable being, had he
not continually present to his mind
the recollection or the anticipation of
a journey to the uttermost parts of
the earth—to the North Pole or the
South Seas, to the feverish heart of
Africa or the scarcely less perilous
wastes of Tartary. That opinion will
be strongly confirmed by the peregrinations
of Mansfield Parkyns.</p>

<p class='c010'>There can be no reasonable doubt
that when the handsome volumes, full
of amusing letter-press and neat
sketches, and externally decorated
with a chubby and Oriental St George
spearing a golden dragon, with bossy
shields and carved scimitars, and
lion’s mane and tail, which Mr Murray
has just published, shall have been as
generally read as they deserve to be,
the tide of enterprising travel will set
strongly in the direction of Abyssinia.
Everybody will take wing for the
land of the Shohos and Boghos;
African outfits will be in perpetual
demand; sanguine railway projectors
will discuss the feasibility of a “Grand
Cairo and Addy Abo Direct” line.
Mr Parkyns tells us, in his preliminary
pages, that he shall estimate the
success of his book, not by his friends’
flatteries or his reviewers’ verdict,
but by its sale. Sale!—why, it will
sell by thousands, in an abridged
form, with a red cover, as the “Handbook
for Abyssinia.” Persons starting
for those parts will ask for Parkyns’
Handbook, just as tenderer
tourists, who content themselves with
an amble through Andalusia, inquire
for Ford’s. That many such starts
will be made, we cannot doubt, after
reading the book in which are so
vividly described the charms of the
pleasant land of Tigrè, the delights
of the journey thither, and of the
abode there. Never was anything so
tempting. The mere introduction
makes us impatient to be off. Mr
Parkyns is resolved to lure his readers,
in his very first chapter, not only
to read his book, but to roam in his
footsteps. Werne’s <cite>Campaign in
Taka</cite> gave us some idea of the advantages
enjoyed by those privileged
mortals to whom it is given to ramble
between the Blue Nile and the Red
Sea; but the German’s narrative,
which we thought striking and startling
enough when we read it, is thrown
into the shade by the vivid and lively
delineations of the friend and comrade
of Prince Shetou. The sanitary,
dietetic, and surgical instructions,
with which, for the benefit of future
travellers in Abyssinia, he preludes
his subject, would alone suffice to inspire
us with an ardent longing to
pass a season in the delightful regions
where they are applicable. The preservation
of health, he justly observes,
should be every traveller’s
chief care, since, without it, pleasure
or profit from the journey is alike
impossible. Then he proceeds to
point out the chief dangers to health
in Abyssinia, and the means of warding
them off. The highlands, he
tells us, are highly salubrious, but
unfortunately one cannot always abide
upon the hills; and down in the valleys
malaria prevails, engendering
terrible inflammatory fevers, to which
four patients out of five succumb, the
fifth having his constitution impaired
for life, or at least for many years.
Parkyns points out a preservative.
Light two large fires and sleep between
them. They must be so close
together that you are obliged to cover
yourself with a piece of hide to avoid
ignition of your clothes. “Not very
agreeable till you are used to it,”
says the cool Parkyns, “but a capital
preventive of disease. Another plan,
always adopted by the natives, is not,
I think, a bad one:—Roll your head
completely up in your cloth, which
then acts as a respirator. You may
often see a nigger lying asleep with
the whole of his body uncovered, but
his head and face completely concealed
in many folds”;—a <em>sort of woodcocking</em>
which may be pleasant, but can
hardly be considered picturesque.
Tobacco is indispensable; in that
country you must smoke abundantly.
On the White Nile no negro is ever
without his pipe, which sometimes
holds a pound of tobacco. “The
largest I now possess,” says Parkyns,
somewhat dolefully, “would not contain
much more than a quarter of that
quantity.” The sun, generally considered
formidable to travellers in
Africa, is disregarded by him to whom
we now give ear. “I never retired
into the shade to avoid the noonday
heat; and for four years I never wore
any covering to my head except the
rather scanty allowance of hair with
which nature has supplied me, with
the addition occasionally of a little
butter. During the whole of that time
I never had a headache”;—an immunity
we are disposed to attribute less
to the sun’s forbearance than to some
peculiar solidity in the cranium of
Parkyns. “In these climates,” he
next informs us, “a man cannot eat
much, or, even if he could, he ought
not.” This probably applies exclusively
to foreigners, for we are afterwards
introduced to native dinners,
where the gormandising surpassed
belief, and yet none of the guests were
a pin the worse. Indeed, in the course
of the book, the Abyssinians are invariably
represented as enormous
feeders, capable of demolishing four
or five pounds of meat, more or less,
raw, as one day’s ration, and without
ill effects. As long as you are moderate
in quantity, the quality of what
you eat is evidently unimportant in a
sanitary point of view. “A man who
cares a straw about what he eats
should never attempt to travel in
Africa. It is not sufficient to say, ‘I
can eat anything that is clean and
wholesome.’ You will often have to
eat things that are far from being
either, especially the former. I have
eaten of almost every living thing that
walketh, flyeth, or creepeth—lion, leopard,
wolf, cat, hawk, crocodile, snake,
lizard, locust, &#38;c.; and I should be
sorry to say what dirty messes I have
at times been obliged to put up with.”
As general rules for the preservation
of health, we are instructed to avoid
bad localities—the valleys, especially
after the rainy season, when the sun
pumps up malaria from stagnant
pools and decayed vegetable matter—to
be abstemious in all respects,
and to follow the native customs with
respect to food, injunctions which appear
difficult to reconcile. Should all
precautions prove ineffectual, and
fever or other ills assail us, kind, considerate
Parkyns, who himself, he
tells us, has some knowledge of the
healing art, instructs us what to do.
“Local bleedings, such as the natives
practise, are often highly advantageous;
and firing with a hot iron may
also be adopted at their recommendation.
For severe inflammation of the
bowels, when you cannot bear to be
touched on the part, <em>some boiling
water poured on it</em> will be a ready and
effective blister,—a wet rag being
wrapped round in a ring to confine
the water within the intended limits.
For bad snake-bites or scorpion stings,
bind above the part as tightly as possible,
and <em>cut away with a knife</em>; then
apply the end of an iron ramrod,
<em>heated to white heat</em>. This, of course,
I mean supposing you to be in the
backwoods, out of the reach of medicines.
Aquafortis is, I have heard,
better than the hot iron, <em>as it eats farther
in</em>.” Actual cautery, boiling-water
blisters, and “cutting away”
really compose a very pretty basis for
a surgical system. Professor Parkyns
gives but few prescriptions, supposing,
he says, that few of his readers
would care to have more, or be likely
to profit by them. Judging from the
above sample, we are inclined to coincide
in his supposition.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Mansfield Parkyns is an amateur
barbarian. Leaving England when
a very young man, he plunged, after
some previous rambling in Europe and
Asia Minor, into the heart of Abyssinia,
and adopted savage life with an
earnestness and gusto sufficiently
proved by his book, and by the regret
with which he still, after three years’
return to what poor Ruxton called
“civilised fixings,” speaks of his
abode in the wigwams of Ethiopia,
and of his hankerings—not after the
flesh-pots of Egypt, but—after the
ghee-pots and uncooked beef he so
long throve upon in the dominions of
the great Oubi, Viceroy of Tigrè.
Fancy a civilised Englishman, gently
nurtured and educated, pitching his
tent for three years amongst filthy
savages, adopting their dress and
usages, rubbing his head with butter,
sleeping with the but of his rifle for a
pillow—the grease from his plaited
locks being “beneficially employed in
toughening the wood”—having himself
partially tattooed, eating raw beef,
substituting raw sheep’s liver soused
in vinegar for oysters, discarding hats
and shoes, and going bareheaded and
barefoot under the broiling sun and
over the roadless wastes of Abyssinia,
burning and gashing his flesh in order
to produce peculiar scars and protuberances,
deemed ornamental by the
people amongst whom he dwelt, and,
upon his return home (to England,
we mean to say, for the home of his
predilection is amongst the savoury
savages he so reluctantly left, and
amongst whom he evidently considers
himself naturalised), coolly writing
down and publishing his confessions—in
most amusing style, we freely
admit, but not without a slight dash
of self-complacency, as if he would
say, See what a fine fellow I am to
have thus converted myself into a
greasy, shoeless, raw-beef-eating savage
for a term of years! We have
nothing in the world, however, to do
with Mr Parkyns’ peculiar predilections.
This is a free country—as the
Yankee observed when flogging his
nigger—whose natives have a perfect
right to exhibit themselves in any
character they please, from an Objibbeway
to an alabaster statue, so long
as they do not outrage decency, or
otherwise transgress the law. For
our part, we should have been sincerely
sorry if Mr Parkyns had not
en-cannibaled himself, and told us
how he did it. We should have been
deprived of two of the most extraordinary,
original, and amusing volumes
through which we ever passed our
paper-knife. We accept the book,
and are grateful for it. With the
author’s tastes, depraved though we
cannot but consider them, we purpose
not to meddle. Men of his stamp
should be prized, like black diamonds,
by reason of their rarity. We are
much mistaken, or Mr Parkyns will
be the cynosure of all eyes during the
approaching spring—particularly if
he condescends occasionally to exhibit
his tattooed arm, and to bolt a raw
beef-steak. Gordon Cumming, on
his return from his South-African
slaughterings, was the lion of the
London season; Mansfield Parkyns
will receive much less than his due if
he be not made its hippopotamus.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Parkyns started from Smyrna
for a tour of the Nile, in company
with the poetical member for Pontefract,
Mr Monckton Milnes, then
pondering his “Palm Leaves.” Of
the Nile tour, so repeatedly made and
so well described by others, he abstains
from speaking, in order the sooner to
get to Abyssinia. After an agreeable
boat voyage of two months’ duration,
he parted from his companion at
Cairo. Mr Milnes must surely have
regretted quitting so lively and intrepid
a fellow-traveller, and Mr Parkyns,
we cannot doubt, equally deplored
their separation. The cool of the
evening would have been so pleasant
in the desert. But parliamentary
duties summoned one of the travellers
northwards; the <i><span lang="de">Wander-trieb</span></i>, the
vagabond instinct, impelled the other
southwards, and so they parted. A
double-barrelled gun, a single rifle, a
brace of double pistols, and a bowie-knife,
composed Mr Parkyns’ travelling
arsenal; he also took with him
three pair of common pistols, a dozen
light cavalry sword-blades, some red
cloth, white muslin, and Turkey rugs,
as presents for Abyssinian chiefs, and
in March 1843 he sailed from Suez for
Jedda, on board a miserable Arab boat,
loaded with empty rice-bags and a
hundred passengers. The throng was
too great to be agreeable, but Mr
Parkyns, who has evidently a happy
temper and a knack at making himself
popular amongst all manner
of queer people, was soon on most
friendly terms with the Turks, Bedouins,
Egyptians, Negroes, and others
who composed the living freight of
the clumsy lateen-rigged craft. The
voyage from Suez to Jedda varies
from nine days to three months. Mr
Parkyns was so fortunate as to accomplish
it in little more than three weeks.
We pass over its incidents, which
amused us when we first read them,
but which have lost their piquancy
now that we recur to them with the
highly-spiced flavour of the Abyssinian
adventures hot upon our palate, and
we go on at once to Massawa Island,
on the Abyssinian coast, whose climate
may be estimated from the remark
made by an officer of the Indian navy
to Mr Parkyns, to the effect that he
thought Pondicherry the hottest place
in India, but that Pondicherry was
nothing to Aden, and Aden a mere
trifle to Massawa. “Towards the
latter end of May I have known the
thermometer rise to about 120° Fahrenheit
in the shade, and in July and
August it ranges much higher.” Indoors,
the natives, men and women,
wear nothing but striped cotton napkins
round their loins. Most Europeans
suffer severely from the heat of
the place. Mr Parkyns, who is first
cousin to a salamander, suffered not
at all, but ran about catching insects,
or otherwise actively employing himself,
whilst his servants lay in the
shade, the perspiration streaming off
them. He is clearly the very man
for the tropics. After ten days at
Massawa, he started for the interior,
previously getting rid of his heavy
baggage, to an extent we should really
have thought rather improvident, but
which, if he had already made up his
mind to content himself with the
comforts, and conform to the customs
of the people he was going amongst,
was doubtless extremely wise. We
have enumerated his stock of arms,
and his assortment of presents for the
natives. The list of his wardrobe,
after he had given away his European
toggery—partly at Cairo, and partly
to Angelo, a Massawa Jew, who
made himself useful and agreeable—is
very soon made out. When he
landed on the mainland, opposite
Massawa, it consisted of “three
Turkish shirts, three pair of drawers,
one suit of Turkish clothes for best
occasions, a pair of sandals, and a
red cap. From the day I left Suez
(25th March 1843), till about the
same time in the year 1849, I never
wore any article of European dress,
nor indeed ever slept in a bed of any
sort—not even a mattress; the utmost
extent of luxury I enjoyed, even when
all but dying of a pestilential fever,
that kept me five months on my beam-ends
at Khartoum, was a coverlet
under a rug. The red cap I wore on
leaving Massawa was soon <em>borrowed</em>
of me, and the sandals, after a month,
were given up; and so, as I have
before said in the Introduction, for
more than three years (that is, till I
reached Khartoum), I wore no covering
to my head, except a little butter,
when I could get it, nor to my feet,
except the horny sole which a few
months’ rough usage placed under
them.” The sole in question had
scarce put its print upon Ethiopian
soil when it was near meeting with
an accident that would have necessitated
the use of the sharp knife and
white-hot ramrod. On his way to the
house of Hussein Effendi, a government
scribe, at the sea-coast village
of Moncullou, Mr Parkyns put his
bare foot near an object that in the
twilight had the appearance of a bit
of stick or stone. “I was startled by
feeling something cold glide over it,
and, turning, saw a small snake
wriggling off as quickly as possible.
From what little I could distinguish
of its form and colour, it seemed to
answer the description I had heard of
the cerastes, or horned viper, which
is about a foot and a half long, rather
thick for its length, and of a dirty,
dusty colour, mottled. The horns
are nearly over the eyes, and about
the eighth of an inch in length. This
is considered one of the most venomous
of the snake tribe, and they are very
numerous in this neighbourhood. I
tried to kill it, but without success.”
He soon came to think very little of
such small deer as this. Snakes are
as common as rats in those torrid
latitudes, and about as little heeded.
On his way to the hot springs of Ailat,
a day’s journey from Massawa, he
killed another horned viper, as it was
coolly wriggling across his carpet,
“spread in a natural bower formed
by the boughs of a species of mimosa,
from whose yellow flowers, which emit
a delicious fragrance, the Egyptians
distil a perfume they call ‘fitneh.’”
After this he makes no mention of
adventures with snakes on account of
their frequency, until he gets to his
chapter on the natural history of Abyssinia,
towards the close of the second
volume, to which we shall hereafter
refer. We are at present anxious to
get up the country, to the court of
King Oubi, whose capital, Adoua,
was Mr Parkyns’ headquarters during
his residence in Tigrè. There he
had what he calls his town-house, of
which he presents us with a plan and
sketches. He remained for some
weeks at Ailat, the Cheltenham of
Abyssinia, whose healing springs
attract visitors from great distances.
There he lodged in the house of a sort
of village chief, called Fakak, and
passed his time shooting. It was
rather an amusing residence, caravans
of Bedouins and Shohos frequently
passing through on their way to and
from Massawa, and he had excellent
sport. The evening before starting
for Kiaguor, three days’ journey on
the road to Adoua,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I went out to procure a supper for
myself and numerous friends and attendants;
and, to tantalise my English sporting
readers, I will tell them what bag I
brought home in little more than an hour.
My first shot brought down four guinea-fowl;
my second, five ditto; third, a
female of the little Ben Israel gazelle;
fourth, her male companion; and, fifth, a
brace of grouse; so that in five shots I
had as good a bag as in England one
would get in an average day’s shooting,
and after expending half a pound of
powder, and a proportionate quantity of
shot, caps, and wads. But I feel it my
duty to explain that <em>I never shoot flying</em>,
considering that unsportsmanlike. A
true sportsman shows his skill by getting
up to his game unperceived, when, putting
the muzzle of his gun as close to the tail-feathers
as he possibly can, he blazes
away into the thick of the covey, always
choosing the direction in which he sees
three or four heads picking in a row!
At any rate, this is the only way you can
shoot in a country where, if you entirely
expend your powder and shot, you must
starve, or else make more, as I have been
obliged to do many a time. I cannot
understand how people in Europe can enjoy
shooting, where one is dependent on
a crowd of keepers, beaters, dogs, sandwiches,
grog, &#38;c.... My sole companion
on ordinary occasions is a little
boy, who carries my rifle, whilst I carry
my gun, and we do all the work ourselves.
His sharp eyes, better accustomed to the
glare than my own, serve me in every
point as well as a setter’s nose. The
country (about Ailat) is sandy and covered
with large bushes. Most of the trees are
thorny, being chiefly of the mimosa tribe,
and their thorns are of a very formidable
description, some of them being about
two inches and a half in length, and as
thick at the base as a large nail; while
another variety, called in Abyssinian the
‘Kantàff-tafa,’ have thin short-curved
thorns placed on the shoots two and two
together. These catch you like the claws
of a hawk, and if they enter your clothes
you had better cut off the sprig at once,
and carry it with you till you have leisure
to liberate yourself, otherwise you will
never succeed; for as fast as you loosen
one thorn another catches hold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Some interesting sporting anecdotes
follow (they abound in Mr
Parkyns’ book), told in off-hand characteristic
style—encounters with wild
pigs, rather dangerous animals to deal
with—and then we take the road to
Kiaguor. A night’s rest there, and
we are off to Adoua. Hereabouts
Mr Parkyns gives a sketch of “Abyssinian
Travelling.” We presume that
he himself, somewhat tanned by the
climate, is the gentleman mounted on
a jackass, with bare head and legs,
and a parasol for protection from the
sun. Suppress the donkey and supply
a parrot, and he might very well
pass for the late Mr R. Crusoe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Vague ideas of columns and obelisks,
Moorish architecture and the
like, floated in Mr Parkyns’ fancy as
he drew near to the capital city of the
kingdom of Tigrè, one of the most
powerful of all Ethiopia. He found a
straggling village of huts, most of
them built of rough stones, and
thatched with straw. The customhouse—they
possess that civilised
nuisance even in Abyssinia—gave
him trouble about his baggage, which
it found exorbitant in quantity, and
suspected him of smuggling in goods
on account of merchants. He explained
that he had a supply of arms,
powder, lead, &#38;c., for two or three
years’ consumption, besides presents
for the prince, but the Tigrè <em>douaniers</em>
insisted on examining all his
packages. He would not submit, and
set off to make an appeal to Oubi—nominally
the viceroy, but in reality
the sovereign of the country—who
was then at a permanent camp, at a
place entitled Howzayn. During this
part of his travels, Mr Parkyns was
in company with Messrs Plowden and
Bell; and on reaching Howzayn,
which they did in a heavy shower of
rain, they went at once to the habitation
of Càfty, the steward of Oubi’s
household, who had been Mr Bell’s
<em>balderàbba</em> on a former visit. “It is
customary for every person, whether
native or foreigner, after his first audience
with the prince, to ask for a
‘balderàbba,’ and one of his officers
is usually named. He becomes a sort
of agent, and expects you to acknowledge,
by presents, any service he may
render you—such as assisting you out
of difficulties in which you may be involved,
or procuring for you admission
to his master when you may desire it.
Càfty was absent on an expedition.
His brother, Negousy, was acting for
him, and he volunteered to procure us
an audience of the prince without
delay.”  Meanwhile the travellers
were not very comfortable. Some
poor fellows were turned out of their
huts into the rain to make room for
them; but the huts let in water so
freely, that the new occupants were
scarcely better off than those who
had been ejected. Only one hut, about
7 feet in diameter, and 5½ feet high,
had a water-tight roof. Imperfect
shelter was but one of their annoyances,
and a minor one. It is a custom
of that country for the king to
send food to travellers as soon as he
hears of their arrival, and our three
Englishmen, aware of this, had brought
no provisions. This was unfortunate,
for Oubi neglected to observe the
hospitable custom, and they were
half starved. Instead of obtaining for
them an immediate interview with the
prince, Negousy, who was fishing for
presents, put them off from day to
day. They were obliged to send a servant
round the camp, crying out,
“Who has got bread for money?”
and offering an exorbitant price; but
even thus they could not obtain a
tithe of what they needed. To add
to their vexations, Mr Parkyns’ servant,
Barnabas, a negro whom he had
engaged at Adoua, was claimed as a
slave by a man in authority, to whose
uncle he had formerly belonged. At
last, on the fourth evening after their
arrival, Oubi sent them a supper.
“It consisted of forty thin cakes,
thirty being of coarser quality for the
servants, and ten of white ‘teff’ for
our own consumption. These were
accompanied by two pots of a sort of
sauce, composed of common oil, dried
pease, and red pepper, but, it being
fast time, there was neither meat nor
butter. To wash all down there was
an enormous horn of honey beer.”
On the morning of the sixth day Oubi
sent for them, and, escorted by Negousy,
they hastened to the Royal
Hovel. They had to wait some time
for admission, amidst the comments
of a crowd of soldiers—comments then
unintelligible to Mr Parkyns, but
which he afterwards ascertained to be
far less complimentary to the personal
appearance of himself and companions
than he at the time imagined—their
eyes being compared to those of cats,
their hair to that of monkeys, and
their skin, to which the sun had
given a bright capsicum hue, being
greatly coveted for red morocco sword-sheaths.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oubi was reclining on a stretcher, in
a circular earthen-floored hut, thirty
feet in diameter. Although it was
the middle of August there was a
fire in the apartment, and Mr Parkyns
was almost blinded by the wood
smoke. When he was able to see, he
beheld “a rather good-looking, slight-made
man, of about forty-five years
of age, with bushy hair, which was
fast turning grey. His physiognomy
did not at all prepossess me in his
favour. It struck me as indicative of
much cunning, pride, and falsity; and
I judged him to be a man of some
talent, but with more of the fox than
the lion in his nature. Our presents
were brought in, covered with cloths,
and carried by our servants. They
consisted of a Turkey rug, two European
light-cavalry swords, four pieces
of muslin for turbans, and two or
three yards of red cloth for a cloak.
He examined each article as it was
presented to him, making on almost
every one some complimentary remark.
After having inspected them
all, he said, ‘God return it to you,’
and ordered his steward to give us a
cow.” The cow proved to be what a
Far West trapper would call very
“poor bull”—a mere bag of bones,
which would never have fetched two
dollars in the market (the value of a
fat cow in Abyssinia varies from 8s.
to 12s. 6d.); but, such as it was, the
taste of meat was welcome to the
hungry travellers, who devoured the
beast the same day they received it,
so that by nightfall not an eatable
morsel was left. Oubi made a better
acknowledgment of their gifts by
settling their difficulty with the chief
of the customhouse, and not long
after this Mr Parkyns parted from
Messrs Bell and Plowden, their routes
no longer lying together. “I prepared
for a journey into Addy Abo,
a province on the northern frontier of
Tigrè, then so little known as not to
be placed on any map. My principal
object in going there was the chase,
and if possible to learn something of
the neighbouring Barea or Shangalla—a
race totally unknown, except by
the reputation they have gained in
many throat-cutting visits paid to the
Abyssinians.” When recording his
parting from his two friends, both of
whom he believes to be still in Abyssinia,
he intimates his intention of
revisiting that country. “It is not
improbable,” he says, “that we three
may meet again, and do what we have
often done before—eat a raw beef-steak,
and enjoy it for the sake of
good company.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The road to Addy Abo took Mr
Parkyns through Axum, the capital
of that part of Abyssinia until
supplanted by Adoua. Axum contains
a tolerably well-built church,
probably of Portuguese construction,
and some neatly-built huts, whilst
broken columns and pedestals tell of
the civilisation of former ages. It
possesses, moreover, a beautiful obelisk
and a very remarkable sycamore
tree, “both of great height, the latter
remarkable for the extraordinary circumference
of its trunk, and the great
spread of its branches, which cast
their dark shade over a space of
ground sufficient for the camp of the
largest caravan. The principal obelisk
is carved on the south side, as if
to represent a door, windows, cornices,
&#38;c.; whilst, under the protecting arms
of the venerable tree, stand five or
six smaller ones, without ornament,
most of which have considerably deviated
from the perpendicular. Altogether
they form a very interesting
family party.” Judging from the present
book, antiquarian researches have
not much interest for Mr Parkyns,
whose sympathies are with the living,
his pleasures in the field and forest,
and who seems more of a sportsman
than of a student. It would be unfair,
however, not to mention, that
whilst enjoying himself in his own
peculiar ways (and some of his ways
certainly were extremely peculiar), he
kept less selfish aims in view, and
exerted himself to make collections
of objects of natural history, of costumes,
arms, and other curiosities,
besides investigating the history and
geography of the country. His collections
were on a very large scale:
unfortunately some went astray upon
the road; others, left for years in warehouses,
and ill cared for by those to
whom they were consigned, were plundered
of their most precious specimens.
The latter was the case with
his first great shipment, of more than
twelve hundred birds, sent to England
by way of Hamburg. Rats and
moths destroyed the contents of another
case, left by mistake for four
years at Aden; and another, containing
arms, silver-mounted ornaments,
and zoological specimens, its owner
supposes to be either at Bombay, Calcutta,
or in some warehouse of the Transit
Company in Egypt. These losses
are the more to be deplored, that they
comprised that of many extremely
rare specimens of birds and monkeys,
some of them from regions into which
it is probable that no European traveller
ever before penetrated. To
make sure of not losing his collection
made in Nubia and on the White Nile,
Mr Parkyns himself went out to fetch
it, and never lost sight of it till he
had it safe at home. It consisted of six
hundred birds, and of about a ton
weight of negro arms and implements.
He was still more unfortunate in geographical
than in zoological matters,
having lost the whole of the observations,
maps, &#38;c. made during his long
residence in Tigrè.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Great Gondar road, along
which Mr Parkyns travelled for some
distance after quitting Axum, bears
about the same resemblance to a civilised
European highway that Oubi’s
smoky cabin bears to the Louvre or
the Escurial. High-roads in Abyssinia
are mere tracks worn by passage.
“The utmost labour bestowed on any
road in that country is, when some
traveller, vexed with a thorn that
may happen to scratch his face, draws
his sword and cuts off the spray. Even
this is rarely done. An Abyssinian’s
maxim is, ‘I may not pass by this
way for a year again; why should I
give myself trouble for other people’s
convenience?’ The road, however,
here as in many parts of Tigrè, is
abundantly watered by several tolerably
copious streams, which flow <em>all</em>
the year round. These are most useful
to the numerous merchants who
pass constantly between Gondar,
Adoua, and the Red Sea, with large
caravans of laden animals, offering
not only ready means for watering
their cattle, but often green food for
them near the banks, when all the
rest of the country is parched up and
dry, and a cool grassy bed for their
own weary limbs to repose upon.”
Hereupon Mr Parkyns breaks out into
rapturous laudation of life in the wilderness,
and advises his readers to
shoulder their rifles, abandon civilised
diggings, and take a few months’
roughing and hardship in a hot climate.
Only in such a life, he maintains, is
real happiness and enjoyment to be
found. His arguments are as original
as his book. The principle that he
goes upon is, that one enjoys nothing
thoroughly until one has suffered from
privation of it. Shade, a patch of
grass, a stream of water, a cloud, are
treasures in Africa, whilst in England
they are unheeded, because easily obtainable.
A draught of water in the
desert, albeit dirty or tar-flavoured,
is more precious than the choicest
Tokay in epicurean <em>blasé</em> Europe; a
piece of scorched gazelle and an ill-baked
loaf, made by putting a red-hot
stone into the middle of a lump of
dough, form a repast more luxurious,
when hunger and exercise supply the
sauce, than ever was placed before
royal <em>gourmet</em> by the most renowned
of France’s cooks. There is not much
fruit in Abyssinia—but, oh! for a good
raw onion for luncheon! Scenting
some of those fragrant bulbs, greedy
Parkyns, during his residence in the
“Happy Valley” of Rohabaita, once
ran two miles up a hill, in the heat of
the day. How he enjoyed himself in
that pleasant province of Rohabaita,
hard by the banks of the Mareb, where
he abode nine months, and to which
he feels disposed to devote many chapters!
He had the good fortune, he
says, during his long stay, to become
considered as one of the country, and
to be offered the government of that
and another province by H.R.H. Dejatch
Lemma, Oubi’s eldest son, who
held authority in the north-western
districts of Tigrè, but who had been
unable to acquire much influence over
the Rohabaitese—rough border-men,
particularly averse to tax-paying, and
who, when pressed for the impost,
fled with their movables across the
frontier. For, in Abyssinia, inattention
to the tax-gatherer’s claim is
terribly punished. In the first instance,
the offender is subjected to a
sort of <em>dragonnade</em>; soldiers are sent
to live upon him, waste his substance,
and treat him brutally; so that, if he
cannot at once borrow money to pay
his debt, he is speedily ruined. Another
means of extortion is still more
barbarous: the insolvent is cast into
prison, and chained by the arm. “The
iron round his wrist is not clasped,
but is merely a strong hoop, opened
by force to allow the hand to enter,
and then hammered tight between
two stones. At first it is only made
tight enough to prevent any possibility
of the prisoner’s escape. After some
time, however, if the sum required be
not forthcoming, it is knocked a little
tighter, and so, by degrees, the hand
dies, the nails drop out, and the poor
prisoner is at best maimed for life.
Death sometimes ensues from this
treatment.” Rather savage work,
Mr Parkyns is fain to admit, whilst
assuring us that this torture is not
often practised, and that his Tigrine
friends, with all their faults, have
many good qualities. Lofty were the
castles he built in Rohabaita (aërial
ones, of course, castles of more solid
structure being rare in a land whose
sovereign is lodged as we have described)
whilst waiting for Oubi’s permission,
for which Lemma was obliged
to apply before installing the Englishman
in his government. Besides the
payment of a tribute to Lemma, Mr
Parkyns undertook to keep in order
the neighbouring tribe of the Bàza,
whom he more frequently speaks of
as the Barea or slaves, that being the
name given to them in Abyssinia.
He was very desirous to visit that
brave and hardy tribe of savages, and
had made all his arrangements to do
so, when Oubi unfortunately determined
on a <em>razzia</em>, in retaliation of
numerous recent murders and robberies
perpetrated by them in his
dominions. In the last of their forays
they had pillaged monasteries, and
slain their holy occupants, whose blood
cried aloud for vengeance. His project
of a pacific ramble amongst the
Barea being thus knocked on the head,
Mr Parkyns hoped that the campaign
itself would give him opportunities of
obtaining an insight into their manners.
He was disappointed. Little
or nothing was seen of the natives
except at the sword’s point. They
appear to be bold and wary warriors,
skilled in the stratagems of savage
warfare. Mr Parkyns, when at Rohabaita,
received a visit and presents
from a friend of his, one Obsabius, a
hospitable old cock, and man in authority,
whom, on his departure, he accompanied
for some distance with a
small escort, Obsabius, when coming,
having seen Barea sign upon the road.
He was convinced that the blacks were
outlying, and that he had escaped attack
only by having joined a number
of other travellers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Scarcely had we passed the brook of
Mai-Chena when one of our men, a hunter,
declared that he saw the slaves. Being
at that time inexperienced in such
matters, I could see nothing suspicious.
He then pointed out to me a dead tree
standing on an eminence at a distance of
several hundred yards, and charred black
by last year’s fire. To explain this, I
should remark that the rains cause to
spring up a thick jungle of grass, canes,
and bushes, which cover the whole surface
of the country, growing to a height
of several feet. When this becomes dry,
it is set fire to—in some places by the
farmers, as the readiest means of clearing
the ground; in others by hunters, to
enable them to get at their game with
greater facility; and often accidentally....
However, all that I saw was a
charred stump of a tree, and a few blackened
logs or stones lying at its foot. The
hunter declared that neither tree nor
stones were there the last time he passed,
and that they were simply naked Barea,
who had placed themselves in that position
to observe us, having no doubt seen
us for some time, and prepared themselves....
So confident was I of his
mistake, that, telling the rest to go on
slowly, as if nothing had been observed,
I dropped into the long grass and stalked
up towards them. A shot from my rifle,
at a long distance (I did not venture too
close), acted on the trees and stones as
powerfully as the fiddle of Orpheus, but
with the contrary effect; for the tree disappeared,
and the stones and logs, instead
of running after me, ran in the opposite
direction. I never was more astonished
in my life; for so complete was the deception,
that even up to the time I fired,
I could have declared the objects before
me were vegetable or mineral—anything,
indeed, but animal. The cunning rascals
who represented stones were lying flat,
with their little round shields placed
before them as screens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The presents brought by the obliging
Obsabius were a supply of food—corn
and honey—for there was considerable
hunger in the Happy Valley
just then, the chase being unproductive,
and the natives having fled from
the apprehension of a tax-gathering
visit from the troops of the extortionate
Oubi. Abstinence, however, is a
good thing in that climate, and Mr
Parkyns never felt himself better
than during this tolerably long period
of semi-starvation. He was never
fatigued, and wounds of all kinds
healed with wonderful rapidity. He
led a rough life in that frontier country,
and wounds were common enough.
“Once, in running down the stony
and almost precipitous path leading
to the Mareb, I struck my bare foot
against an edge of rock, which was as
sharp as a razor, and a bit of flesh,
with the whole of the nail of my left
foot little toe, was cut off, leaving
only the roots of the nail. This latter
I suppose to have been the case, for
it has grown all right again. I could
not stop longer than to <em>polish off</em> the
bit which was hanging by a skin, for
we were in chase of a party of Barea,
who had cut the throats of three of
Waddy Hil’s nephews the night before,
but was obliged to go on running
for about twenty miles that afternoon,
the greater part of the way up to our
ankles in burning sand. Whether
this cured it, I know not, but I scarcely
suffered at all from it the next day,
and forgot it the day after.” Thorns
in the feet—no trifling prickles, but
three or four inches long—were picked
out by the half-dozen at a time; and
such, says Mr Parkyns, is the force of
habit and the thickness of skin one
acquires, that such an operation is
thought no more of than an English
sportsman would of kicking away a
clod of clay clinging to his shooting-shoes.
But to return to the Barea.
Oubi remained nearly two months in
their country, which he completely
traversed—so completely, indeed, as to
have unintentionally (?) committed
depredations on certain tribes to the
north, claimed as tributary by the
Egyptians. Although good fighting
men, the Bàza have too little idea of
united action, and are too ignorant of
modern improvements in the art of
slaughter, to make head against their
Abyssinian enemies when these take
the field in force. Their idea of cavalry
is very ludicrous. They imagine them
to be old or infirm men, carried by
horses because they cannot keep up
with their comrades on foot! “So in
their campaigns, whenever the Bàza
are met by cavalry, they amuse themselves
at their expense by facetiously
plucking handfuls of grass and holding
them towards the horses, and calling
them ‘Tish, Tish,’ &#38;c. They appear
never able to understand how the firearms
of their adversaries kill them.
Occasionally it has been noticed that
when a man has fallen among them
by a gun-shot wound, his neighbours
will assist him up, imagining him to
have stumbled; should life be extinct,
they manifest their astonishment at
finding him dead from some unseen
cause, and when, on examining his
body, they discover the small round
hole made by the ball, they will stare
at it, poke their fingers into it, and
absolutely laugh with surprise and
wonder.” Notwithstanding these artless
ways, the Bàza are ugly customers
in a hand-to-hand tussle—one
of them usually proving more than a
match for two Abyssinians, and Mr
Parkyns relates several anecdotes
illustrative of their physical superiority.
But we feel desirous to take
a glance at his town life, which has
even greater novelty than his chapters
of wild adventure, and so we return
with him to Adoua, whither he went
to pass the rainy season when he left
Rohabaita. He waited several months
for Oubi’s consent to his installation
as governor; but before it arrived he
received long-expected supplies from
England, and abandoned his ambitious
and philanthropical schemes—unfortunately
for the Rohabaitese, to the
improvement of whose physical and
moral condition they tended, and fortunately
for the Barea, against whom
he proposed to organise a system of
moss-trooping, to result in much profit
in ivory and buffalo hides.</p>

<p class='c010'>The delay of remittances from Europe
rendering it probable that Mr
Parkyns would be detained for some
time in Abyssinia, he resolved completely
to domesticate himself with
the natives, as the best way of studying
their habits and mode of life.
This he seems to us to have done
from the very commencement; for, as
he justly observes, “there is nothing
like a civil tongue, and quiet unpretending
manners, to get one on in
those countries;” so, upon principle,
he always showed himself ready to
answer questions, and to do the amiable,
and even to put up with savage
familiarities and intrusions, which he
would gladly have dispensed with:
as, for instance, during his stay at
Addaro, a village of Addy Abo, formerly
an important market, but now
decayed and almost deserted. It was
there that he first saw the snake-killing
secretary bird, called Farras Seytan,
or the Devil’s Horse, from the
astonishing swiftness with which it
runs. He was the first white man
who had ever entered the place, with
the exception of two French medical
men, who had passed through some
years previously on their way to the
Mareb, and one of whom was carried
off by fever, and the other by a crocodile,
“picked out by the voracious
animal from the colour of his skin,
whilst swimming between two guides.”
So a white skin was a great curiosity
in Addaro; and here we come to a
plate representing Mr Parkyns reclining
on a settle, receiving perpetual
visitors, whilst he jots down in his
journal the following memoranda:—“Blessed
with a swarm of bees that
have lodged in the house. They have
stung me several times; but I can
bear that, especially as they have also
stung some of my importunate visitors,
who, by this means, are kept
away. In fact, the only method I
have to rid myself of my friends is to
stir up the bees—to rid myself of the
bees, I am obliged to stir up the fire,
which is kept burning all day for the
cooking; but, by the time the bees
are gone, the hut is intolerable. Fancy
a roaring fire, and lots of smoke, at
noon in one of the hottest places in
Abyssinia.” His visitors were of a
mixed description, and not all of agreeable
aspect; and, upon the whole,
they bothered him no little with their
interminable questionings, attempts
to extort presents, and squabbles
amongst themselves; but it would
have been impolitic to turn them out,
except by the indirect agency of the
bees; and, moreover, he seems to
possess one of those even, <em>insouciant</em>
tempers, hard to ruffle, which we take
to be a prime requisite for a man who
sojourns amongst savages, and without
which he certainly would not have
been able to say, at the end of his
second volume, that, during nine years’
travel, he never met with a companion,
of whatsoever colour, station,
or religion, who gave him a moment’s
cause to quarrel with him, or from
whom he parted otherwise than with
regret. Far be it from us to doubt
the word of Mr Parkyns; but we would
ask him if he really grieved at relinquishing
the society of an elderly warrior—his
“friend,” he calls him—who
sat close to him at Addaro, looking
over him as he wrote, and begging to
be set down in his book? “His name
is Welda Georgis. He is naturally
very ugly; nor is his appearance at
all improved by the want of his nose,
which he says he lost in battle. He
cannot speak at all without stopping
the holes with his fingers; hence his
voice, especially when he speaks loud,
is, as may be judged, not the most
harmonious; and just now he is raising
it to a considerable pitch, being
excited to wrath by one of his companions
insinuating that he was never
but in one battle, and that then he
ran away before a blow had been
struck.” An imputation not to be
borne; and, accordingly, in the plate
we see Welda Georgis and the other
gentleman engaged in single combat
upon the floor. Presently Mr Parkyns
is disturbed in his writing by a
bang, by a scream from a woman who
is boiling a pot (a child in a bag on
her back), and by a “Wa!” from
Welda Georgis, who, ignorant of the
dangers of a little knowledge, has
been retailing to his friends instructions
he had received the day before
in the art of cocking double-barrelled
pistols. He had cocked both barrels,
but had pulled the left trigger whilst
holding the right hammer. A gourdful
of capsicum paste and a corn-jar
were mortally wounded, but no other
damage was done. Welda laid down
the weapon, which he evidently suspected
of foul play, looked gravely at
it, and apostrophised it as “a naughty
devil!” Easy-going Mr Parkyns
took all these trifles with an excellent
grace, as became a man of strong
nerves, who had gone out to rough it,
and who had no desire to leave his
bones in Abyssinia, or to have his
physical integrity in any way deteriorated.
He smilingly put up with intruders,
and even with spies. He
could not go out for a walk without
being followed. There is a notion
abroad in those parts that Europeans
<em>make</em> money. This was confirmed,
in the case of Mr Parkyns, by his
happening to have a great many new
dollars. When he put one in circulation,
the receiver would exclaim,
“Wa! this is only just made; see
how it shines!” So somebody always
accompanied him, when he strolled
out with his gun, under pretence of
showing him game, but in reality to
watch his motions, thinking to catch
him in the very act of coining. It does
not appear that these scouts took
much by their curiosity. “I often
retire to the neighbouring hills” (thus
runs one of the brief verbatim quotations
from his journal, occasionally
given by Mr Parkyns) “when about
to take an observation, or for some
other reason wishing to be undisturbed,
and seek out some snug little nook
or corner amongst the rocks. Scarcely,
however, have I time to make my
preliminary arrangements, when, looking
up, I find two or three heads curiously
peering into my retreat, fully
persuaded that they are about to behold
the entire process of extracting
dollars from the earth, ready stamped
with the august head of her Imperial
Majesty. Sometimes they were most
laughably disappointed in their expectations.”
All this was at an early
period of Mr Parkyns’ abode in the
country; the natives had not got used
to him, and he had not yet become a
complete Abyssinian; and, as we
have already seen, Addaro is an out-of-the-way
place, where whites are
rare. To see him to advantage, we
must accompany him to Adoua, notwithstanding
that he tells us he was
less happy there, and exerted himself
less to write down what he observed,
than “in the more genial solitude of
the backwoods;” the reason being,
that “Adoua is a capital (!), though
a small one; and in all capitals, whether
great or small, I feel out of my
element, losing at once my health,
spirits, and energy and disposition for
work.” The force of imagination,
the magic of a name, can hardly farther
go. Let us see what were the
employments and pursuits of this wild
man of the woods in the village metropolis
of Tigrè, in which the houses
of the wealthy are square and flat-roofed,
whilst those of the poorer
classes have a conical thatch of straw.
They seem to have consisted in noting
native peculiarities, in taking part in
native banquets and merry-makings,
and in setting the fashion to Young
Abyssinia. It is time, by the by,
that we should say a word of his intimate
friend, Shetou, a fine fellow
and daring soldier, but no favourite
with his father, Oubi, who took every
opportunity of snubbing him, and
showed a marked preference for his
puny elder brother, Lemma. “Shetou
has rather a slang way of dressing,
which greatly offends his father.
Sometimes he comes in with one leg
of his trousers drawn up in the proper
manner above his calf, and the
other dangling down about his ankle.
On such an occasion, it would not be
at all extraordinary should Oubi,
after looking at him fixedly, and in
his usual quiet smiling manner, begin,
in the presence of all assembled,
‘Well done, son of a Mahommedan
mother! Pretty way of wearing your
breeches, isn’t it? Some new fashion
of your own, eh?’ And, turning to
the <em>agafari</em> (doorkeepers), ‘Turn him
out! turn him out!’ The poor lad is
put out in the most neck-and-crop
manner, and, returning to his tent, he
broods over this treatment, and vows
vengeance on his brother, Lemma,
who, from being the favourite, is partly
the cause of it.” A prince of the
blood-royal must naturally feel incensed
at being ignominiously ejected
from the court of his despotic dad, for
no greater offence than the fanciful
sit of his breeks. But whose fault is
it? No one’s, if not that of Mr Parkyns,
the Brummel of that foreign
court, the promoter of all manner of
sartorial extravagances and innovations.
“This” (a particular cut of
trouser) “was considered so very
ultra-fashionable that, except Dejatch
Shetou, myself, and one or two others,
few dared attempt it. It was I and
my friend Shetou who first introduced
the habit of allowing the sword to
swing perpendicularly from the side,
instead of its sticking out horizontally,
like a dog’s tail; as well as of wearing
the belt over the hips, instead of
round the waist, and up to the armpits,
as it was worn when I first arrived.
These, with the increased
length of trousers, reaching, as we
wore them, nearly to the ankle, and
so tight below that it took an hour to
draw them over the heel, gave a very
‘fast’ look.” Mr Parkyns has immortalised
his name in Tigrè, and
will be spoken of with admiration by
future generations, to whom his fame
will be handed down by the dandies
to whom he set so bright an example.
The incompatibility of cleanliness and
elegance in Abyssinia rather shocks
our European prejudices. The great
“go,” we are told, amongst the dandies
in those parts, is “to appear in
the morning with a huge pot of butter
(about two ounces) placed on the
top of the head, which, as it gradually
melts in the sun, runs over the hair,
down the neck, over the forehead,
and often into the eyes, thereby causing
much smarting.” The grease is
wiped from the brow and eyes with
<em>the quarry</em> or cloth, a garment compared
by Mr Parkyns to the Roman
toga, and which it is the fashion to
wear dirty, a clean one being considered
“slow.” But the town life
of the young fashionables of rank in
the chief cities of Abyssinia, may best
be summed up and exhibited in an
extract from Mr Parkyns’ thirty-eighth
chapter, where he shows himself
to us in all his glory as the D’Orsay
of Adoua.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was leading,” he says, “the life of
an Abyssinian gentleman ‘about town,’
my hair well tressed, my pantaloons always
of the newest, frequently of an
original cut; in dull weather setting
fashions, disputing and deciding on the
merits and demerits of shields and spears;
in fine weather swelling about the town
with a quarter of a pound of butter melting
on my head, face, neck, and clothes,
and with a tail of half a dozen well-got-up
and equally greasy soldiers at my
heels; doing the great man, with my
garment well over my nose, at every
festival and funeral worth attending;
‘hanging out’ extensively when I had a
few shillings to spend; sponging on my
neighbours when, as was oftener the case,
I had nothing;—in fact, living a most
agreeable life on a very limited income.
I cannot deny that I look back to those
times with a certain feeling of regret.
It was the only period of my life in which
I ever felt myself a really great man. I
‘cry very small’ in England, with a much
greater expenditure. The men will not
look after me with admiration, nor the
girls make songs about me here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Parkyns! fallen from your
high estate, dwindled from an African
savage into an English gentleman!
We wretched, civilised Europeans are
rather in the <i><span lang="la">nil admirari</span></i> vein, but
we will answer for your being “looked
after” with curiosity and wonderment,
by all who have read your book, if
you will but adopt some distinguishing
mark by which you may be recognised
when you walk abroad. As
to the songs, whose absence you deplore,
we can only say that if you
are not taken for the subject of romantic
ditties by the poetesses of
England, as you were by those of
Tigrè, it will certainly not be because
the theme is unsuggestive. Innumerable
incidents in your Abyssinian
career deserve to be commemorated in
flowing metre, and sung by Ethiopian
serenaders to banjo accompaniment,
and to the ancient and pathetic melody
of “The King of the Cannibal Islands.”
And this reminds us to accompany
you to one of the festivals you above
allude to—a dinner party at Adoua—first
advising ladies to have their salts
at hand, and permitting squeamish
readers to pass over a page if it so
please them. Here are a score of
Abyssinian gentlemen squatted, sword
in hand, on cut grass round a low
table. It is perhaps unnecessary to
mention that the tablecloth has been
forgotten, and that napkins are absent,
their place being supplied by
cakes of bread, on which the guests
wipe their fingers after dipping them
in the dish or smearing them with
the blood of the raw meat. The
cooked dishes are first brought in and
their contents distributed by waiters,
who cut the meat or tear it with
their fingers into pieces of a convenient
size. They also take a piece of
bread from before each person, sop it
in the sauce, and return it to him.
“The guests take their bread and
sauce and mix them together into a
sort of paste, of which they make
balls, long and rounded like small
black puddings (black enough, we
doubt not); these they consider it
polite to poke into their neighbours’
mouths; so that, if you happen to be
a distinguished character, or a stranger
to whom they wish to pay attention,
which was often my case, you are in
a very disagreeable position; for your
two neighbours, one on each side,
cram into your mouth these large
and peppery proofs of their esteem so
quickly, one after the other, that, long
before you can chew and swallow the
one, you are obliged to make room
for the next.” Surely these can hardly
be included amongst the “happy
moments” Mr Parkyns so pathetically
regrets, when recording, towards the
close of his work, his tearful parting
from his Adoua friends—the first time,
he says, since his arrival in the country,
that he felt the want of a pocket-handkerchief.
Let us, however, proceed
with our repast, after a glance
at the accompanying plate of the
“Dinner Party,” where a favoured
guest, with distended jaws, is undergoing
the cramming process. This
first course, of cooked dishes, is usually
mutton; whilst it is being gobbled
up, a cow is killed and flayed outside,
and as soon as the first course is removed,
in comes the raw meat—the
<em>broundo</em>, as it is called—brought in by
servants in quivering lumps.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is usually a piece of meat to
every five or six persons, among whom
arises some show of ceremony as to which
of them shall first help himself; this
being at length decided, the person chosen
takes hold of the meat with his left hand,
and with his sword or knife cuts a strip
a foot or fifteen inches long from the part
which appears the nicest and tenderest.
The others then help themselves in like
manner. If I should fail in describing
properly the scene which now follows, I
must request the aid of the reader’s imagination.
Let him picture to himself
thirty or forty Abyssinians, stripped to
their waists, squatting round the low
tables, each with his sword or knife or
‘shotel’ in his hand, some eating, some
helping themselves, some waiting their
turn, but all bearing in their features the
expression of that fierce gluttony which
one attributes more to the lion or leopard
than to the race of Adam. The imagination
may be much assisted by the idea of
the lumps of raw pink-and-blue flesh
they are gloating over.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Some still more full-flavoured details
follow, which we abstain from
extracting, thinking we can fill up
the space remaining to us better than
by their transcription, and referring
those curious in such matters to chapter
xxvii., “Manners and Customs,”
where they will see how the pepperballs
already spoken of are got rid of
by those into whose mouths they are
thrust, how boys lie under the table
and act as scavengers, and how Mr
Parkyns expresses his belief that raw
meat, eaten whilst yet warm, would
be preferred to cooked meat by any
man who from childhood had been
accustomed to it. In the chapter
headed “Religion, &#38;c.,” which “&#38;c.”
comprises a variety of strange things,
we are told of “a small entertainment”
he gave to a select party of friends
on the occasion of the great festival
of Mascal or the Cross, a season celebrated,
like Christmas in England,
by hospitality and good cheer. He sent
out his cards for an early hour, knowing
that his guests would have several
other feeds to attend in the course
of the day. But when he had done
this, his conscience smote him, for he
reflected that, with half a dozen other
breakfasts and dinners in view, his
friends would but take the sharp
edge off their appetites in his wigwam,
and husband their masticatory
and digestive powers for the subsequent
banquets. “My rather savage
feelings of hospitality,” he says, “were
piqued at the idea of their leaving me
without being well filled. But truly
I was agreeably disappointed; for a
fine fat cow, two large sheep, and
many gallons of mead, with a proportionate
quantity of bread, disappeared
like smoke before the twelve
or fourteen guests, leaving only a few
pickings for the servants.” Mr Parkyns
met several of these hungry
gentlemen at other dinners in the
course of the same day, and was
utterly confounded to observe that
most of them played as good a knife
and fork (we mean sabre and fingers)
at every ensuing repast as they had
done at his. The capacity of an
Abyssinian stomach is evidently incalculable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The 19th and 37th chapters of Mr
Parkyns’ work are amongst those that
please us best. In the earlier of the
two he is on his way from Axum to
Addàro, across a vast open plain,
embellished with a great variety of
flowers; amongst them a kind of scarlet
aloe, met with in most parts of
Tigrè, and flowering at all seasons,
and countless mimosas, pink, yellow,
and white, some of them so fragrant
as to scent the whole neighbourhood,
adding their perfume to that of a profusion
of jessamine. “There is also
a beautiful parasitical creeper, growing,
like the mistletoe, from the bark
of other trees. It has a bright dark-green
fleshy leaf, with brilliant scarlet
flowers.” But Mr Parkyns is not
much of a botanist; zoology, and
especially ornithology, are his favourite
pursuits, and, a capital shot, he
bagged as many specimens as he
chose. “Rifle-shooting,” he modestly
says, “was about the only thing in
the world I could do well.” The <em>was</em>
is to be deplored. It is thus accounted
for. Near Addàro, a hunter, either
accidentally or mischievously, set fire
to the jungle. Mr Parkyns was then
staying in a hamlet, situated on a
small hill. It consisted but of three
compounds, one of which he and his
servants occupied; another was inhabited
by a farmer named Aito Hablo,
with his wife and family; and in the
third dwelt a cast-off wife and children
of the same Aito. Divorces are
not difficult to obtain in that country.
One morning, all hands were roused
by the crackling of flames close at
hand. The hillock was surrounded by
fire, gradually creeping up the slope.
The huts were roofed with sticks and
straw, and the ground was covered
with long dry grass. There was no
time to lose. Tearing down green
boughs from the trees, the men, whilst
the women and children lit counterfires
upon the plan usually adopted in
such cases, “made rushes at the
flames, whenever a lull of the wind
allowed them to approach them, and,
by beating them with the boughs, in
some measure impeded their progress
till the space was cleared and the huts
were out of danger. I and one of my
servants happened to rush at the fire
at an unlucky moment; for a breeze
rising drove the flames towards us just
as we got near them, and we were
badly scorched.” Besides other injuries,
the optic nerve of Mr Parkyns’
right eye was damaged, and this
spoiled his rifle-shooting. “Formerly,”
he says, “I managed occasionally
to shoot from my left shoulder—a
habit which I found useful in stalking,
as in some positions you must
necessarily expose yourself before you
can bring your right shoulder forward.
Now that I am obliged to trust to my
left alone, I find it a very poor substitute
for the right.” Even after this
unlucky accident, however, we find
Mr Parkyns very dexterously picking
off bird and beast, to supply his table
or enrich his collection. He tells some
capital sporting anecdotes, and others,
equally good, of his queer pets, and
of his experience amongst the monkeys.
About half-way across the
mimosa-scented plain, he came to a
well-wooded ravine, the trees in which
swarmed with the “tota” or “waag,”
a beautiful little greenish-grey monkey,
with black face and white whiskers,
which allows men to approach very
near to it. But the cleverest of this
class of animals met with in Abyssinia
is the Cynocephalus, or Dog-faced
Baboon, a formidable animal,
of extraordinary sagacity, to which it
is really difficult to refuse the possession
of reasoning powers. Mr Parkyns
sketches these creatures on a foray.
“Arrived at the corn-fields, the scouts
took their position on the eminences
all around, whilst the remainder of
the tribe collect provisions with the
utmost expedition, filling their cheek-pouches
as full as they can hold, and
then tucking the heads of corn under
their armpits. Now, unless there be
a partition of the collected spoil, how
do the scouts feed? for I have watched
them several times, and never observed
them to quit for a moment
their post of duty till it was time for
the tribe to return, or till some indication
of danger induced them to take
to flight.” Outlying one night on the
frontier, Mr Parkyns was roused by
most awful noises, and started up in
alarm, thinking the Barea were upon
him. It was but the baboons. A
leopard had got amongst them. They
habitually dwell in lofty clefts of the
rock, whither few animals can follow
them; but the leopard is a good
climber, and sometimes attacks them.
The Abyssinians say that he seldom
ventures to attack a full-grown ape—and,
judging from the formidable
canine teeth displayed in the skull
sketched by Mr Parkyns, the leopard
is in the right. Driven to stand at
bay, these baboons are dangerous opponents,
but they have not sufficient
courage to act on the offensive.
“Were their combativeness proportioned
to their physical powers, coming
as they do in bodies of two or
three hundred, it would be impossible
for the natives to go out of the village
except in parties, and armed; and,
instead of little boys, regiments of
armed men would be required to guard
the corn-fields. I have, however, frequently
seen them turn on dogs, and
have heard of their attacking women
whom they have accidentally met
alone in the roads or woods. On one
occasion I was told of a woman who
was so grievously maltreated by them,
that, although she was succoured by
the opportune arrival of some passers-by,
she died a few days after, from
the fright and ill-treatment she had
endured.” We are reminded of Sealsfield’s
striking Mexican sketch of the
<i><span lang="es">zambos</span></i>. Mr Parkyns had a female
dog-face as a pet. She was young
when he got her; and, from the first,
her affection for him was ludicrously
annoying. As she grew older she
was less dependent, and cared less
about being left alone. The master
of a German brig who went up the
country for a cargo of animals, gave
Mr Parkyns a copy of “Peter Simple.”
Besides the Bible and the “Nautical
Almanack,” this, he says, was the first
English book he had seen for two
years, and he sat down greedily to
devour it. “‘Lemdy’ was as usual
seated beside me, at times looking
quietly at me, occasionally catching a
fly, or jumping on my shoulder, endeavouring
to pick out the blue marks
tattooed there.” The group is suggestive
for a sculptor; a thousand
pities no Abyssinian Canova was at
hand to model it. Mr Parkyns went
to light his pipe, imprudently leaving
the book and the monkey together.
On his return he found the latter
seated in his place, and gravely turning
over the leaves of Marryat’s novel;
but, not understanding English, she
turned them too quickly, and had torn
out half the volume. “During my
momentary absences she would take
up my pipe and hold it to her mouth
till I came back, when she would restore
it with the utmost politeness.”
At Khartoum, some time after the
termination of his Abyssinian wanderings,
Mr Parkyns became very intimate
with three large monkeys of
this intelligent species, and with their
showman—“so much so, that I travelled
with them for some days, acting
as his assistant, my duty being to
keep the ring, which I did by gracefully
swinging round me two wooden
balls covered with red cloth, and
fastened, one at each end, to a rope
similarly ornamented—and occasionally
to assist the monkeys in collecting
coppers. I passed a very agreeable
time with him, and he told me many
anecdotes of monkeys, as well as the
usual tales of ghouls, fire-worshippers,
&#38;c., for which all Egyptians, especially
of his erratic habits, are celebrated.”
If this be not a joke—and
there is no reason to take it for one,
since Mr Parkyns, who is a sort of
African Gil Blas (only more scrupulous
in certain respects than his
Spanish prototype), was evidently,
at that time of his life, eccentric and
adventurous enough to adopt on the
instant any wild freak that entered
his head—we hope to have a more
detailed account of his association
with the showman when he favours
us with the narrative of his post-Abyssinian
travels, not forgetting the
anecdotes of monkeys (he tells two or
three very good ones), and the traditions
of ghouls and fire-worshippers.
We are sure that he must there have
materials for at least one long chapter;
and we feel particular curiosity
about the traditions, because the supernatural
seems to partake, in tropical
Africa, of the strange, fantastical,
exaggerated character of the animal
and vegetable productions of the
country. Extraordinary stories are
there current of tribes of monsters,
semi-human, dwelling in the unexplored
parts of the country—such as
the Beni-Kelb or Dog-men (mentioned
by Werne), “whose males are
dogs, and females beautiful women;
and the Beni-Temsah (sons of the
crocodile), who have human bodies,
but heads like those of their ancestor’s
family. I have heard of the former
of these nations in almost every country
I have visited in Africa, from
Egypt to the White Nile, including
Kordofan and Abyssinia, and even in
Arabia, whither their fame has been
carried, doubtless, by pilgrims. They
are, by most, believed to exist near
the Fertit country (south of Darfour),
where there are copper-mines, and the
people of which file their teeth to
points, saw-fashion.... There
is no tribe in this part of Africa, indeed
scarcely an individual, but believes
in the existence of a race of
men with tails. For my own part, I
have heard so much of them that I
can scarcely help fancying there must
be some foundation for such very
general belief.” Great diversity of
opinion exists as to the whereabouts
of these tail-bearers, some placing
them to the north, others to the south
of Bàza, and others in the centre of
Africa—convenient, because unexplored.
A black Fàky or priest, a
speculative genius, whose acquaintance
Mr Parkyns made in Abyssinia,
gave him some information about his
future route across Africa, and warned
him against certain cannibal tribes
south of Darfour, by whom white
meat, being a rarity, is much esteemed,
as having a fat delicate look.
“He told me that a brown man, a
Mahommedan priest, who went there
from his country, in the hope of converting
the people to Islamism, was—though
protected from actual danger
by his sanctity—a very tempting
object among them, so much so, that
whenever he went out the little children
came about him, poking him with
their fingers in the ribs, feeling his
arms and legs, and muttering to one
another, ‘Wa-wa, wa-wa!’ (meat,
meat), with their mouths watering,
and their features expressive of the
greatest possible inclination to taste
him.” We will back Mr Parkyns
against the field for the humorous
dressing-up of extravagant stories of
this kind, and for an occasional dash
of dry comical exaggeration, too obvious
to mislead. His choice of pet
animals was rather of the strangest.
For some time he kept a “tokla”
(<i><span lang="la">Canis venaticus</span></i>), which was as nearly
tame as its wild vicious nature admitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In appearance Tokla was more curious
than beautiful. He had a little
lean body, which no feeding could fatten,
covered with a darkish brindly-spotted
coat not unlike a hyena’s, and supported
by legs as unlike those of any other animal
as possible, being in colour white,
with dark leopard spots, the hind-legs
remarkably long, and so doubled under
him that when walking, or rather prowling
about, it was doubtful if he touched
the ground oftenest with his feet or
<em>elbows</em>.... To account for his perpetual
thinness, it only requires to state
his mode of feeding. He would take a
huge piece of meat or offal, and put it
into his stomach at once, seemingly entire,
for he never appeared aware that
his wonderfully muscular jaws and double
row of teeth were at all available for
mastication. Having thus bolted his
dinner, his belly became distended till it
nearly touched the ground; then he
would go and lie down for twenty-four
hours or more, according to the quantity
he had eaten; after which he would return
to be fed, as empty and starved-looking
as ever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A useful, profitable, and agreeable
inmate must the said Tokla have
been. Mr Parkyns’ regard for him
seems to have arisen from a sort of
sympathetic feeling for the unflinching
pluck and endurance displayed
on various occasions by the ill-conditioned
little brute. A friend of his,
knowing his partiality to pet animals,
made him a present of a young
jackal, which he had knocked over
with a stick, when it was labouring
under the effects of a surfeit of locusts.
Jackal was hospitably received, and
a bed of cotton wool made up for
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rising early one morning, I found
that he and Tokla had entered into an
alliance most offensive to the fowls, one
of whom they had caught, and were
dragging about the yard—the one holding
by a foot, the other by a wing. The
moment I appeared, Cobero (the jackal)
let go the fowl and limped back to his
corner. Tokla, more determined, I had
to beat off, which I did with great difficulty,
and not until the poor fowl was so
lacerated that I was constrained to kill
it. Excited by its death-struggles, he
again laid hold; so I held up the fowl
with him dangling to its wing until I was
tired, and then swung him round and
round, over and over, in hopes of his jaws
tiring; but in this I was disappointed,
for he held on till the wing breaking off
threw him heavily on his back to a distance
of several yards. Even in his fall
he was great, for he neither uttered a
sound of pain nor loosened his hold, but,
getting up, stalked away quite proudly
with the wing in his mouth. I was so
much pleased with him that I gave him
the body and all. In this, perhaps, I
acted wrong, for we afterwards found
that if we didn’t kill all the poultry he
would, and so I gave up ever keeping
any more. Poor little Tokla! I grew
very fond of him, for, though rough and
ugly, he had such pretty winning ways—he
seemed always hungry, and would
often bite people’s legs, occasionally my
own, not at all from vice, but sheer appetite.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon the whole, life in Abyssinia
bears much resemblance to life in a
menagerie, so familiar and intrusive
are the wild beasts of the field.
Hyenas prowl about the villages, and
enter houses in quest of a supper.
They are far from dainty in their
diet, and will eat leathern bags and
wearing apparel. “It once occurred
to me,” says Mr Parkyns, “as it has
often to people I have known, to be
awakened by one of them endeavouring
to steal my leathern bed from
under me.” They are too cowardly
to attack anything capable of defence,
but occasionally they take a bite out
of a sleeper and run away—first
scratching him with their paw (so
the Abyssinians assert) to be sure
that he sleeps soundly, and then
snatching their mouthful. As for
lions, they frequently prowled around
Mr Parkyns’ bivouacs, but were not
aggressive, and it was not even necessary
to light fires to keep them off.
The buffalo-hunters of Rohabaita
used, upon the contrary, to light
their camp-fires in holes, and conceal
their glare with branches of trees,
that the blaze might neither scare
the buffalo nor bring down the
Barea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never killed a lion during all my
stay in Africa,” says Mr Parkyns, with
meritorious candour—seeing that he
might, without fear of contradiction, have
set down to his own rifle any number of
the kings of the forest. “I perhaps
should have done so, had I known what
a fuss is made about it at home; but in
Abyssinia it is not an easy thing to accomplish....
At night I have often
watched for them, but generally without
success; and when they did come, it was
next to impossible to shoot them. Besides,
it is an awkward thing for a man,
armed only with a single rifle of light
calibre, to take a flying shot at a lion in
the dark, especially when he has no one
to back him on whose courage or shooting
he can rely. You hear a lion roar in the
distance; presently a little nearer; then
you start up at hearing a short bark close
by; and if there be a fire or moonlight,
perhaps you may see a light-coloured
object gliding quickly past from one bush
to another. Before you are sure whether
or no you saw anything, it is gone. You
sit watching for a moment, rifle in hand,
expecting him to appear again, when
(how he got there you know not) his roar
is heard at a considerable distance off in
an opposite direction; and thus you go
on for an hour or two, when, getting
sleepy, you politely request him to take
himself off to a certain warm place, and,
returning your rifle between your legs,
roll over and go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Long habit and strong reliance on
the mansuetude of the Abyssinian
lions must, we should think, be indispensable
to slumber under such circumstances.
We can hardly fancy a
man’s being lulled to rest by a lion’s
roar, and sinking into one of the deep
and heavy sleeps common in that
country, with the consciousness that
when he awakes he may possibly behold
a hyena gallopping off with his
cheek in its mouth,<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> or find a few
scorpions walking over his body,
leisurely stinging him. “Scorpions
are abundant everywhere in the hot
districts; no house but is full of them.
I have been stung several times by
them, but without any serious consequences,
though I have heard of many
instances which have ended fatally.”
Mr Parkyns, we presume, at once
applied the keen blade and actual
cautery recommended in his Introduction.
What with incidental scars of
this kind, his tattoo decorations, and
the scars he voluntarily made upon
his arm by an Abyssinian process
similar to the moxa of European surgery,
and which is done by those
people partly as ornamental and
partly to show their fortitude under
pain, his epidermis must have rather
a remarkable appearance when exposed
by the scantiness of costume in
which he informs us that he sometimes
travelled—<i><span lang="es">en cueros</span></i>, namely,
when on solitary roads, and with a
piece of rag or hide round the loins
when in populous districts. We certainly
never met with or heard of any
traveller who embraced savagery with
such earnestness and hearty goodwill
as Mr Parkyns; and we sincerely
congratulate him upon his escape with
trifling detriment from the perils and
exposure he not only encountered but
enthusiastically sought.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tigrè is rich in reptiles. Of the
extent of this undesirable wealth, a
few lines, culled here and there from
the chapter on Natural History, will
give a vivid idea. “The crocodile is
plentiful in every brook or hole where
there is water enough to conceal him.”
A poor German, who attached himself
for a time to Mr Parkyns, and
tended him carefully when he was
laid up with a terrible attack of ophthalmia,
imprudently walked into a
river to cool himself, and suddenly
disappeared, either sucked in by a
whirlpool or carried off by a crocodile—the
latter, Mr Parkyns thought,
most probably the case; notwithstanding
which, we come, a few pages
afterwards, to a plate of the bold traveller
crossing the same rapid and
dangerous stream, aided by half a
dozen swimming blacks, and apparently
heedless of the fact that crocodiles,
like the cannibals south of Darfour,
show a decided preference for
white meat. “There are many snakes,
centipedes, and large venomous spiders,
of the tarantula kind, in the hot
low districts. There is a great variety
in the smaller sort of snakes: the cerastes
or horned viper, asp, a species
of cobra, the puff adder, and many
others of all sizes and colours, from a
pale pink to the brightest emerald
green, are met with in Abyssinia and
the adjacent countries. I was told
of a horned serpent that was killed
some years ago, which appears to
have been a monstrosity, either in
reality or in the imagination of my
informants. They describe it as
about seven feet long, nearly two
feet in circumference, with scarcely
any diminution towards the tail, and
wearing a pair of horns three inches
in length. It is commonly reported
that dragons, or rather flying lizards
of very venomous nature, are to be
met with in Walkait.” A pleasant
country for pic-nics in the woods.
Going one day to shoot at a mark in
a long narrow gully close to Rohabaita,
where the village wells were,
Mr Parkyns had just paced off the
distance, and was building a rough
target of stones, when his servant
started back, and pulled him with
him, calling out, “Temen, temen!”
(snake). There was a rustling in the
jungle that rose abruptly on either
side of the watercourse, which was
only a few feet wide. Not knowing
what <em>temen</em> meant, but supposing it
was some wild animal, Mr Parkyns
called loudly to his second attendant
to bring the gun. “All this passed
in a moment’s time; and although
only one hundred and fifty yards off,
long before the gun arrived I had seen
two magnificent boa-constrictors, one
about ten yards from the other, quietly
leave their places, without attempting
to molest us, and ascend the hill, till
they were lost in jungle, whither I
never cared to pursue them. The
first thing I saw after the rustle was
a head, which appeared for a moment
above the canes, then a body, nearly
as thick as my thigh, and then they
disappeared, the movement of the
canes alone marking the direction they
had taken.” What Mr Parkyns says
he himself saw we duly credit, whilst
fully sharing his intimated incredulity
with respect to the winged dragons,
and the apocryphal horned monster.
Before believing in them, we should
like to see them—not, by any means,
roaming at large in the state of vigour
promoted by their own burning climate,
but properly stuffed, or carefully
wrapped in flannel and securely caged,
in the gardens of the Zoological Society.</p>

<p class='c010'>Although it may with perfect truth
be said that no chapter of Mr Parkyns’
book is devoid of strong interest
of one kind or other, all are not equally
attractive; and we have preferred
dwelling at some length upon the section
of natural history to extracting
any of the horrible stories of Abyssinian
cruelty which he relates under
the head of “Anecdotes of Character.”
He himself seems to doubt
whether they might not have been
as well omitted, but perhaps he was
right in deciding to give them, in order
to supply data for a fair estimate of
the national character of that singular
people, which he might otherwise have
been suspected of placing in too favourable
a light. Persons to whom
narratives of murder, torture, barbarous
mutilation, and savage cruelty
are odious and intolerable, have only
to treat the pages 187 to 222 of
the second volume as the monkey
treated those of “Peter Simple”—turn
without reading them, although
we warn them that by so doing they
will miss some very characteristic and
curious matter. Portions of the chapter
devoted to “Physical Constitution,
Diseases, &#38;c.,” may be trying
to delicate stomachs, but for such Mr
Parkyns has not written—as may be
judged from one or two extracts already
given. Amongst the traits of
character, &#38;c., we find some remarkable
anecdotes of Arab swordsmanship.
An Abyssinian having treacherously
murdered one of the Arab
allies of the Tigrè chiefs (merely for
the sake of gratifying the exorbitant
vanity inherent in all those people,
by displaying the barbarous trophies
taken from his victim), the murdered
man’s friends claimed the assassin’s
blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The crime being proved against him,
Oubi gave him over to their tender mercies.
His punishment was most summary.
Before they had left the presence
of the prince, one of the relations of the
deceased, drawing his heavy two-edged
broadsword, cut the culprit through with
one blow; and, turning to Oubi, said, in
Arabic: ‘May God lengthen your life,
oh my master!’—just as he would have
done had he received a present from his
hands; and then, picking up a wisp of
grass from the floor, walked away, wiping
his blade with as much <em>sangfroid</em> as if
nothing had occurred. Oubi is said to have
expressed much admiration at the manly
off-hand way in which this was done, as
well as at the wonderful display of swordsmanship.
I know, from very good authority,
that the facts of the Arab being murdered,
and the subsequent execution of the criminal,
are true, though I was not present
when it occurred. I do not dispute the
fact; I do not wish any of my readers, who
think such a feat impossible, to believe it
in the present instance. I have known
for certain of the same feat being performed
by Turks with their crooked
sabres, but never by an Arab with his
straight sword.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr Parkyns subjoins a note relating
to the campaign in Taka in which
Werne shared.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Some of the prisoners
then made were, as recorded by Werne,
treated with great barbarity. We do
not remember his mentioning the exact
circumstances now recorded; but he
separated from the Egyptian army before
its return to Khartoum, in order
to join the expedition up the White
Nile. Certain chiefs, Mr Parkyns
tells us, being marched off to be made
examples of on the marketplace of
Khartoum, paused on the road and refused
to proceed. “Suliman Cushif,
who commanded the escort, having
orders that all such should be put to
death on the spot, is said to have
practised his swordsmanship on them
by cutting them through at the waist
as they stood. My friend, Moussa
Bey, in the same expedition, unintentionally
cut a horse’s head clean off....
Seeing one of his men turn
his horse’s head and make for the
jungle, he determined to check so
dangerous an example by summary
means, and so gave chase to the fugitive.
Being better mounted, he soon
came up with him; but the Arab, not
liking his appearance as he stood up
in his stirrups with his nasty little
crooked olive-brown blade, ready for
a back-stroke, threw his horse suddenly
back on his haunches, and dropped
off; the horse’s head went up just in
time to receive the blow aimed at
his master”—and dropped off too, it
would appear. Mr Parkyns knows,
he says, plenty more such anecdotes—and
indeed such anecdotes are plentiful
enough in other countries than
Africa—but nothing is more difficult
than to sift the inventions from the
verities. Haydon the artist, who
seems to have been partial to such
tales, and ready enough to credit
them, relates some astounding exploits
collected from his model life-guardsmen—amongst
others a story of
a cut received by a French dragoon
at Waterloo, which went through
helmet and head, so that the severed
portion dropped on the shoulder like
a slice of apple. We have not the
volume at hand to refer to, but this
is the substance of the incident, told
nearly in the same words. Such cuts
as that—like the flying dragons of
Abyssinia—we must see before believing
in them. At the same time,
a swordsman’s power depends so
much more upon the mode in which
his cuts are delivered than upon mere
brute strength—upon skill than upon
violence—that it becomes difficult to
assign exact limits to the possible
effect of a good blade in adroit and
practised hands. The cutting through,
at the waist, of a slender Oriental, will
hardly appear an impossibility to those
who have seen the now commonplace
feat of severing a leg of mutton at a
blow. Moussa Bey’s “nasty little
crooked olive-brown blade” must unquestionably
have been dexterously
wielded to decapitate, at a single blow,
his fugitive follower’s charger, allowing
even that the latter was the slenderest
and most ewe-necked of its
race. Oubi’s admiration of the sweeping
blow of his Arab auxiliary was
not surprising, since his own subjects
have difficulty in inflicting a serious
wound with their clumsy sickle-shaped
falchions, of great length of blade, and
with hilts of such awkward and inconvenient
construction as to paralyse the
play of the swordsman’s arm. These
hilts are cut out of solid pieces of
rhinoceros horn, at great waste of
material, and a handsome one costs
as much as £2 sterling. The sword
is worn on the right side, that the
Abyssinian warrior may not, when he
has thrown his lance, have to disturb
the position of his shield, and so uncover
himself, whilst drawing his
weapon across his body. Such, at
least, is the explanation Mr Parkyns
gives. But the whole military equipment
of the Abyssinians is far from
formidable. They are tolerably expert
in throwing the javelin, but with
firearms they are extremely clumsy;
and, notwithstanding their large buffalo-hide
shields, a European, who has
any knowledge of the sword, is more
than a match for the best of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was my original intention” (we
revert to Mr Parkyns’ Introduction)
“to write solely on the habits of the
people, without bringing myself into
notice in any part of the story; but
from this I was dissuaded by being
told that, without a little personal
narrative, the book would be unreadable.
I have, therefore, divided the
subject into two parts—Travel, and
Manners and Customs.” Your dissuasive
friends, Mr Parkyns, were in
the right, and you showed your good
sense by taking their advice—in <em>form</em>
as regards the first volume, in <em>fact</em>
as regards also the greater part of the
second. Personal narrative is evidently
your forte; a humorous, rollicking,
letter-writing style, the one
you have most at your command.
The “exuberant animal spirits, not
dependent on temporary excitement,
but the offspring of abstemious habits,
combined with plenty of air and exercise—the
feeling which inspires a calf
to cock his tail, shake his head, kick
and gallop about—which swells a
pigmy into a Hercules, and causes a
young hippopotamus to think of adopting
the ballet as his profession,”—which
you declare to be the reason of
your addiction to savage life, and
which you so enjoyed in Abyssinia,
had evidently not abandoned you
when dressing up your journal for
the press within the civilised precincts
of the Nottinghamshire County-hall,
whence you date your dedication to
Lord Palmerston. Your style, of
which you unnecessarily deprecate
criticism, is spirited, racy, and abundantly
good for the subject. When
the mass of your book is so highly
interesting, it may seem unkind to
mention that a few of your jokes are
a little the worse for wear, and remind
us too strongly of the departed
Miller to add much to the originality
of your otherwise extremely original
and capital volumes; and if we touch
on that point, it is merely in the hope
that you will take the hint in a kindly
spirit, and profit by it when preparing
for the press the “ponderous heap of
papers” you inform us you accumulated
during four and a half years’
travel in Nubia, Kordofan, and Egypt.
Prepare them by all means, at your
leisure, and with care, and let us have
them in type at the earliest convenience
of yourself and publisher. After
your present work, we shall expect
much from them, and do not fear being
disappointed. As to attacking your
statements, in the way of impugning
your veracity, such temerity would
never enter our minds. We will not
say that we have not at times been
startled, almost staggered, as we read
with foot on fender, and much enjoyment,
the narrative of your strange
experience; but, as you justly observe,
stay-at-home critics sometimes
get hold of the wrong end of the stick,
and sneer at truth whilst swallowing
exaggerations. We beg, then, to assure
you that, until we ourselves have
passed a season in Abyssinia, with
butter on our hair, and nothing on our
feet—until we have dined upon raw
beefsteaks, with fingers for forks, and
a curved sabre for a carving-knife—we
shall never venture to question the
strict correctness and fidelity of any
portion of your singular narrative—an
assurance you may safely accept as
a guarantee of impunity at our hands,
even though you should draw a far
longer bow than we believe you to
have done in the case of the country
of which you have so pleasantly written.
Of one thing we are convinced,
and that is, that few who take up
<cite>Life in Abyssinia</cite> will lay it down
without reading it through, and without
exclaiming, when they come to
the end, “What an amusing book
this is, and what an agreeable savage
is Mansfield Parkyns!”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PART III.—CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“My patience! but ye’ll no tell
me, Miss Menie, that yon auld antick
is the doctor’s aunt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She was no older than my father,
though she was his aunt, Jenny,” said
Menie Laurie, with humility. Menie
was something ashamed, and had not
yet recovered herself of the first
salute.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nae aulder than the doctor!—I
wouldna say; your mamma hersel is
no sae young as she has been; but
the like of yon!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look, Jenny, what a pleasant
place,” said the evasive Menie;
“though where the heath is—but I
suppose as they call this Heathbank
we must be near it. Look, Jenny,
down yonder, at the steeple in the
smoke, and how clear the air is here,
and this room so pleasant and lightsome.
Are you not pleased, Jenny?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yon’s my lady’s maid,” said Jenny,
with a little snort of disdain.
“They ca’ her Maria, nae less—set
her up! like a lady’s sel in ane of
your grand novelles; and as muckle
dress on an ilkaday as I’ve seen
mony a young lady gang to the kirk
wi’, Miss Menie—no to say your ain
very sel’s been plainer mony a day.
Am I no pleased? Is’t like to please
folk to come this far to an outlandish
country, and win to a house at last
with a head owre’t like yon?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whisht, Jenny!” Menie Laurie
has opened her window softly, with a
consciousness of being still a stranger,
and in a stranger’s house. The pretty
white muslin curtains half hide her
from Jenny, and Jenny stands before
the glass and little toilet-table, taking
up sundry pretty things that ornament
it, with mingled admiration
and disdain, surmising what this, and
this, is for, and wondering indignantly
whether the lady of the house can
think that Menie stands in need of
the perfumes and cosmetics to which
she herself resorts. But the room is
a very pretty room, with its lightly-draped
bed, and bright carpet, and
clear lattice-window. Looking round,
Jenny may still fuff, but has no reason
to complain.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Menie, leaning out, feels the
soft summer air cool down the flush
upon her cheeks, and lets her thoughts
stray away over the great city yonder,
where the sunshine weaves itself
among the smoke, and makes a
strange yellow tissue, fine and light
to veil the Titan withal. The heat is
leaving her soft cheek, her hair plays
on it lightly, the wind fingering its
loosened curls like a child, and Menie’s
eyes have wandered far away with
her thoughts and with her heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>Conscious of the sunshine here,
lying steadily on the quiet lawn, the
meagre yew-tree, the distinct garden-path—conscious
of the soft bank of
turf, where these calm cattle repose
luxuriously—of the broad yellow
sandy road which skirts it—of the
little gleam of water yonder in a distant
hollow—but, buoyed upon joyous
wings, hovering like a bird over an
indistinct vision of yonder pier, and
deck, and crowded street—a little
circle enclosing one lofty figure, out of
which rises this head, with its natural
state and grace, out of which shine
those glowing ardent eyes—and
Menie, charmed and silent, looks on
and watches, seeing him come and go
through all the ignoble crowd—the
crowd which has ceased to be ignoble
when it encloses him.</p>

<p class='c010'>And voices of children ringing
through the sunshine, and a sweet,
soft, universal tinkle, as of some fairy
music in the air, flow into Menie
Laurie’s meditation, but never fret
its golden thread; for every joy of
sight and sound finds some kindred
in this musing; and the voices grow
into a sweet all-hail, and the hum of
distant life lingers on her ear like the
silver tone of fame—Fame that is
coming—coming nearer every day,
throwing the glow of its purple royal,
the sheen of its diamond crown upon
his head and on his path—and the
girl’s heart, overflooded with a light
more glorious than the sunshine, forgets
itself, its own identity and fate,
in dreaming of the nobler fate to
which its own is bound.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A young friend of yours?—you
may depend upon my warmest welcome
for him, my dear Mrs Laurie,”
says a voice just emerging into the
air below, which sends Menie back in
great haste, and with violent unconscious
blushes, from the window.
“Mr Randall Home?—quite a remarkable
name, I am sure. Something in
an office? Indeed! But then, really,
an office means so many very different
things—may be of any class, in fact—and
a literary man? I am delighted.
He must be a very intimate
friend to have seen you already.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie waits breathless for the answer,
but in truth Mrs Laurie is very
little more inclined to betray her secret
than she is herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have known him for many
years—a neighbour’s son,” said Mrs
Laurie, with hesitation; “yet indeed
it is foolish to put off what I must
tell you when you see them together.
Randall and my Menie are—I suppose
I must say, though both so
young—engaged, and of course it is
natural he should be anxious. I have
no doubt you will be pleased with
him; but I was hurried and nervous
a little this morning, or I should have
postponed his first visit a day or two,
till we ourselves were less perfect
strangers to you, Miss Annie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I beg——” said Miss Annie Laurie,
lifting with courteous deprecation her
thin and half-bared arm. “I felt
quite sure, when I got your letter,
that we could not be strangers half
an hour, and this is really quite a delightful
addition;—true love—young
love!—ah my dear Mrs Laurie, where
can there be a greater pleasure than
to watch two unsophisticated hearts
expanding themselves? I am quite
charmed—a man of talent, too—and
your pretty little daughter, so young
and so fresh, and so beautifully simple.
I am sure you could not have
conferred a greater privilege upon me—I
shall feel quite a delight in their
young love. Dear little creature—she
must be so happy; and I am sure
a good mother like you must be as
much devoted to him as your darling
Menie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs Laurie, who was not used to
speak of darling Menie, nor to think
it at all essential that she should be
devoted to Randall Home, was considerably
confused by this appeal,
and could only answer in a very quiet
tone, which quite acted as a shadow
to Miss Annie’s glow of enthusiasm,
that Randall was a very good young
man, and that she had never objected
to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The course of true love never did
run smooth,” said the greatly interested
Miss Annie. “My dear Mrs
Laurie, I am afraid you must have
had some other, perhaps more ambitious
views, or you could not possibly—with
your experience, too—speak
with so little interest of your dear
child’s happiness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Menie ventured to glance out.
The lady of the house swayed lightly
back and forward, with one foot on
the ground and another on the close
turf of the little lawn, switching the
yew-tree playfully with a wand of
hawthorn; and the wind blew Miss
Annie’s long ringlets against her
withered cheek, and fluttered the lace
upon her arm, with a strange contempt
for her airy graces, and for the
levity so decayed and out of date
which Menie felt herself blush to see.
Opposite, upon the grass, stood Mrs
Laurie, the sun beating down upon
her snowy matron-cap, her healthful
cheek, her sober household dignity.
But the sun revealed to Menie something
more than the natural good
looks of that familiar face. Mrs
Laurie’s cheek was flushed a little.
Mrs Laurie’s fine clear dark eye wandered
uneasily over the garden, and
Mrs Laurie’s foot patted the grass
with a considerable impatience. Half
angry, disconcerted, abashed, annoyed,
Menie’s mother could but half-conceal
an involuntary smile of amusement,
too.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my child’s happiness is very
dear to me,” said Mrs Laurie, with
half a shade of offence in her tone.
“But Menie is very young—I am in
no haste to part with her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, my dear, youth is the time,”
said Miss Annie, pathetically—“the
first freshness, you know, and that
dear, sweet, early susceptibility, of
which one might say so many charming
things. For my part, I am quite
delighted to think that she has given
her heart so early, so many experiences
are lost otherwise. I remember—ah,
I remember!—but really,
Mrs Laurie, you surprise me. I see
I must give my confidence to Menie.
Poor little darling—I am afraid you
have not encouraged her to confide
all her little romantic distresses to
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have always respected Menie’s
good sense,” said Mrs Laurie hastily.
Then she made a somewhat abrupt
pause, and then glanced up with her
look of disconcertment and confusion,
half covered with a smile. “I am
Menie’s mother, and an old wife now,
Miss Annie. I am afraid I have lost
a great deal of that early susceptibility
you spoke of—and I scarcely
think my daughter would care to find
it in me—but we are very good friends
for all that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Mrs Laurie’s eye, glistening
with mother pride, and quite a different
order of sentiment from Miss
Annie’s, glanced up involuntarily to
Menie’s window. Menie had but time
to answer with a shy child’s look of
love out of her downcast eyes—for Menie
shrank back timidly from the more
enthusiastic sympathy with which her
grand-aunt waited to overpower her—and
disappeared into the quiet of her
room to sit down in a shady corner a
little, and wind her maze of thoughts
into some good order. The sun was
drawing towards the west—it was
time to descend to the shady drawing-room
of Heathbank, where Randall
by-and-by should be received for
the first time as Miss Annie Laurie’s
guest.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is very pleasant here, in the
shady drawing-room of Heathbank.
Out of doors, these grassy slopes,
which Menie Laurie cannot believe to
be the heath, are all glowing with sunshine;
but within here, the light falls
cool and green, the breeze plays
through the open window, and golden
streaks of sunbeams come in faintly
at one end, through the bars of the
Venetian blind, upon the pleasant
shade, touching it into character and
consciousness. It is a long room
with a window at either end, a round
table in the middle, an open piano in
a recess, and pretty bits of feminine-looking
furniture straying about in
confusion not too studied. The
walls are full of gilt frames, too, and
look bright, though one need not be
unnecessarily critical about the scraps
of canvass and broad-margined water-colour
drawings which repose quietly
within these gilded squares. They
are Miss Annie Laurie’s pictures, and
Miss Annie Laurie feels herself a connoisseur,
and is something proud of
them, while it cannot be denied that
the frames do excellent service upon
the shady drawing-room wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs Laurie has found refuge in the
corner of a sofa, and, with a very fine
picture-book in her hand, escapes from
the conversation of Miss Annie, which
has been so very much in the style of
the picture-book that Menie’s mother
still keeps her flush of abashed annoyance
upon her cheek, and Menie
herself lingers shyly at the door, half
afraid to enter. There is something
very formidable to Menie in the enthusiasm
and sympathy of her aunt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My pretty darling!” said Miss
Annie—and Miss Annie lifted her
dainty perfumed fingers to tap Menie’s
cheeks with playful grace. Menie
shrank back into a corner, blushing
and disconcerted, and drooped her
head after a shy girlish fashion, quite
unable to make any response. “Don’t
be afraid, my love,” said the mistress
of the house, with a little laugh.
“Don’t fear any jesting from me—no,
no—I hope I understand better these
sensitive youthful feelings—and we
shall say nothing on the subject, my
dear Menie—not a word—only you
must trust me as a friend, you know,
and we must wait tea till he comes—ah,
till <em>he</em> comes, Menie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Poor Menie for the moment could
have wished <em>him</em> a thousand miles
away; but she only sat down, very
suddenly and quietly, on a low seat
by the wall, while Miss Annie tripped
away to arrange some ornamental
matters on the tea-table, where her
little china cups already sparkled, and
her silver tea-pot shone. Menie took
courage to look at her kinswoman’s
face as this duty was being performed.
Withered and fantastic in its decayed
graces, there was yet a something of
kindness in the smile. The face had
been pretty once in its youthful days—a
sad misfortune to it now, for if it
were not for this long-departed, dearly
remembered beauty, there might have
been a natural sunshine in Miss Annie
Laurie’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>As it was, the wintry light in it
played about gaily, and Miss Annie
made very undeniable exertions to
please her visitors. She told Menie
of her own pursuits, as a girl might
have done in expectation of a sharer
in them; and to Mrs Laurie she gave
a sketch of her “society,” the few
friends who, Menie thought, made up
a very respectable list in point of
numbers. Mrs Laurie from her sofa,
and Menie on her seat by the wall,
looking slightly prim and very quiet
in her shy confusion, made brief answers
as they could. Their entertainer
did not much want their assistance;
and by-and-by Menie woke
with a great flush to hear the little
gate swing open, to discern a lofty
figure passing the window, and the
sound of a quick step on the gravel
path. Randall was at the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>And Randall, looking very stately,
very gracious and deferential, came
through the shower of “delighteds”
and “most happys” with which Miss
Annie saluted him, with a bow of
proud grace and much dignity of
manner, to Mrs Laurie’s extreme
surprise, and Menie’s shy exultation.
Another hour passed over very well.
The strangers grew familiar with Miss
Annie; then by-and-by they strayed
out, all of them, into the sweet evening
air, so full of charmed distant
voices, the hum and breath of far-off
life; and Menie found herself, before
she was aware, alone under a sky
slowly softening into twilight, in a
pretty stretch of sloping turf, where
some young birch-trees stood about
gracefully, like so many children resting
in a game, with Randall Home by
her side.</p>

<p class='c010'>And they had found time for various
pieces of talk, quite individual
and peculiar to themselves, before
Menie lifted her face, with its flush of
full unshadowed pleasure, and, glancing
up to the other countenance
above her, asked, “When is the next
book coming, Randall?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What next book, May Marion?”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was his caressing name for
her, as May alone was his father’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>The</em> next book—our next book,”
said Menie. “I do not know much,
nor maybe care much, about anybody
else’s. Randall—our own—when is
it coming?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What if it should never come at
all?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall drew her fingers through
his hand with playful tenderness, half
as he might have done with a child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes—but I know it is to come at
all, so that is not my question,” said
Menie. “I want to know <em>when</em>—not
if. Tell me—for you need not be
coy, or think of keeping such a secret
from me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you never hear that it is
dangerous to hurry one work upon
another?” was the answer somewhat
evasively given. “I am to be prudent
this time—there is peril in it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Peril to what?” Menie Laurie
looked up with simple eyes into a face
where there began to rise some faint
mists. Looking into them, she did
not comprehend at all these floating
vapours, nor the curve of fastidious
discontent which they brought to
Randall’s lip and brow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My simple Menie, you do not
know how everything gets shaped
into a trade,” said Randall, with a
certain condescension. “Peril to reputation,
risk of losing what one has
gained—that is what we all tremble
for in London.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Randall!” Menie looked up again
with a flush of innocent scorn. He
might speak it, indeed, but she knew
he could mean nothing like this.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a slight pause—it might
be of embarrassment—on Randall’s
part; certainly he made no effort to
break the silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But a great gift was not given
for that,” said Menie rapidly, in her
unwitting enthusiasm. “People do
not have unusual endowments given
them to be curbed by such things as
that; and you never meant it, Randall;
it could not move <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Randall only drew his hand
fondly over the fingers he held, and
smiled—smiled with pleasure and
pride, natural and becoming. He had
not been sophisticated out of regard
for the warm appreciation and praise
of those most dear to him. He might
distrust it—might think the colder
world a better judge, and the verdict
of strangers a safer rule, but in his
heart he loved the other still.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Menie’s thoughts were disturbed,
and moved into a sudden ferment.
Her hand trembled a little on
Randall’s arm; her eyes forsook his
face, and cast long glances instead
over the bright air before them; and
when she spoke, her voice was as low
as her words were quick and hurried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It does not become me to teach
you, but, Randall, Randall, you used
to think otherwise. Do you mind
what you used to say about throwing
away the scabbard, putting on the
harness—Randall, do you mind?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mind many a delightful hour up
on the hillside yonder,” said Randall
affectionately, “when my May Marion
began to enter into all my dreams
and hopes; and I mind about the
scabbard and the harness no less,”
he continued, laughing, “and how I
meditated flashing my sword in the
eyes of all the world, like a schoolboy
with his first endowment of gunpowder;
but one learns to know that the
world cares so wonderfully little about
one’s sword, Menie; and moreover—you
must find out for me the reason
why—this same world seems to creep
round one’s-self strangely, and by-and-by
one begins to feel it more decorous
to hide the glitter of the trenchant
steel. What a coxcomb you make
me,” said Randall, abruptly breaking
off with a short laugh; “one would
fancy this same weapon of mine was
the sword of Wallace wight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie made no answer, and the
discontent on Randall’s face wavered
into various shades of scorn,—a
strange scorn, such as Menie Laurie
had never seen before on any face—scorn
half of himself, wholly of the
world.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I knew I had succeeded,”
said Randall at length, with still a
tone of condescension in his confidence,
“I was a little elated, I confess,
Menie, foolish as it seems, and
thought of nothing but setting to
work again, and producing something
worthy to live. Well, that is just the
first impulse; by-and-by I came to
see what a poor affair this applause
was after all, and to think I had better
keep what I had, without running
the risk of losing my advantage by a
less successful stroke. After all, this
tide of popularity depends on nothing
less than real ‘merit,’ as the
critics call it; so I apprehend we will
have no new book, Menie; we will be
content with what we have gained.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If applause is such a poor affair,
why be afraid of the chance of losing
it?” said Menie; but she added hastily,
“I want to know about Johnnie
Lithgow, Randall; is it possible that
he has come to be a great writer
too?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I only knew what you meant
by a great writer <em>too</em>,” said Randall,
with a smile. “Johnnie Lithgow is
quite a popular man, Menie—one of
the oracles of the press.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it a derogation, then, to be a
popular man?” said the puzzled Menie;
“or is he afraid to risk his fame,
like you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The lofty head elevated itself slightly.
“No. Johnnie Lithgow is not
a man for fame,” said Randall, with
some pride. “Johnnie does his literary
work like any other day’s work;
and, indeed, why should he not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie looked up with a blank look,
surprised, and not comprehending.
Even the stronger emotions of life,
the passions and the anguishes, had
never yet taken hold of Menie; still
less had the subtle refining, the artificial
stoicism of mere mind and intellect,
living and feeding on itself;
and Menie’s eye followed his slight
unconscious gestures with wistful
wonderment as Randall went on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After all, what does it signify—what
does anything of this kind signify?
One time or another appreciation
comes; and if appreciation never
should come, what then? So much
as is good will remain. I do not care
a straw for applause myself. I rate it
at its own value; and that is nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It began to grow somewhat dark,
and Menie drew her shawl closer.
“I think it is time to go home,” she
said softly; and as she spoke, a vision
of the kindly home she had left—of
the brave protecting hills, the broad
fair country, the sky and atmosphere,
all too humble for this self-abstraction,
which answered in clouds and
tears, in glorious laughter and sunshine,
to every daily change—rose up
before her; some tears, uncalled for
and against her will, stole into Menie’s
eyes. With a little awe, in her
innocence, she took Randall’s arm
again. He must be right, she supposed;
and something very grand
and superior was in Randall’s indifference—yet
somehow the night air
crept into Menie’s heart, as she had
never felt it do before. Many an
hour this soft night air had blown
about her uncovered head, and tossed
her hair in curls about her cheeks—to-night
she felt it cold, she knew not
why—to-night she was almost glad to
hurry home.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“Randall Home is a very superior
young man,” said Mrs Laurie, with
quiet approbation. “Do you know,
Menie, I had begun to have serious
thoughts about permitting your engagement
so early?—if my only bairn
should leave me—leave me, and get
estranged into another house and home,
with a man that was a stranger in his
heart to me. Whisht, Menie—my
darling, what makes you cry?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Menie could not tell; the night
air was still cold at her heart, and she
could not keep back these unseasonable
tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I am better pleased to-night
than I have been for many a day,”
said Mrs Laurie. “I never saw him
so kindly, so like what I would desire.
I was a little proud of him to-night,
if it were for nothing but letting
Miss Annie see that we are not all
such common folk as she thinks down
in the south country—though, I suppose,
I should say the north country
here. Menie! he will lose my good
opinion again if I think he has vexed
you. What ails you, bairn? Menie,
my dear?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know what it is, mother—no,
no, he did not vex me. I suppose
I am glad to hear you speak of him
so,” said the shy Menie, ashamed of
her tears. The mother and daughter
were in their own room preparing for
rest, and Menie let down her hair
over her face, and played with it in
her fingers, that there might be no
more remark or notice of this unwilling
emotion. It was strange—never
all her life before had Menie wept for
anything indefinite: for childish provocations—for
little vexations of early
youth—for pity—she had shed bright
transitory tears, but she had never
“cried for nothing” until now.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I am pleased,” said Mrs
Laurie, as she tied her muslin cap
over her ears: “what did you say,
Menie? I thought this coming to
London would satisfy me on the one
point which is likely to be more important
than all others, and I was
right. Yes, Menie, lie down, like a
good girl; you must be wearied—and
lie down with a good heart—you have
a fair prospect, as fair as woman could
wish. I am quite satisfied myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But how it came about that Menie
only slept in broken snatches—that
Menie dreamt uncomfortable dreams
of harassment and annoyance—dangers
in which Randall forsook her—cares
of which he had no part—Menie
did not know. A day ago, and Mrs
Laurie’s unsolicited avowal of “satisfaction”
had lifted Menie into the
purest glow of joy, but to-night she
cannot tell what makes her so restless
and uneasy—what prompts her
now and then to fall a-weeping, all
unwillingly, and “for nothing.” Alas
for Menie Laurie’s quiet heart!—something
has come to trouble the waters,
but in other guise than an angel’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>The grass is soft and mossy under
the elm trees, and the morning air—a
world of sweetness—beautifies their
every branch and stem. Down yonder
in the hollow, low at your feet, Menie
Laurie, the great slave Titan has
wakened to his daily toil. Is that
the sweep of his mighty arm stirring
the heavy mist which hangs above
him? Is this the clang of his ponderous
tools ringing up faintly into the quiet
skies? The children are not astir yet,
to seek their pleasure in these precincts.
Nothing seems awake in this
composed and sober place; but yonder,
with many a conflict in his heart,
with many a throbbing purpose in his
brain, with life and strength tingling
to his finger-points, with sighs and
laughter swelling in his breath—yonder
great vassal of the world is up
and doing, holding the fate of a new
day undeveloped in his busy hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>And you, young wondering heart,
look out upon him, innocent, ignorant,
wistful, like an angel on the threshold
of the world—nothing knowing the
wiles and snares, the tortures and
deliriums that live yonder under the
battle-cloud, unacquainted with those
prodigious penalties of social life,
which yonder are paid and borne
every hour; but looking out with
your head bent forward, and your
innocent eyes piercing far in the
dreamy vision of reverie, making
wistful investigation into the new
marvels round you, pondering and
bewildered in your own secret soul.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall—looking out thus through
the morning light upon the city, one
can see him in so many aspects;—the
light shines upon his lofty head, reaching
almost to the skies, like the hill
of his quiet home—and Menie lifts
her eyes to follow that noble daring
look of his, piercing up through mortal
clouds and vapours to do homage
with the gifts God has given him, at his
Master’s throne and footstool; but anon
there steals a cloud round the hero
of Menie’s vision—a dim background,
which still reveals him, not less clearly,
nor with less fascination, but with a
sadder wonder of interest—for Randall’s
eyes are bent earthward, Randall’s
lofty head is bowed, and Menie,
though she watches him with yearning
curiosity, can never meet his downcast
look to read what is there—can
never fathom what lies within the
veiled heart and self-abstracted soul.
You would think now that her eyes
are caught by the sunshine yonder
making such mischievous confusion
among the city vapours: Not so; for
Menie’s eyes, under that troubled
curve of her forehead, are studying
Randall, and see only an incomprehensible
something in him, overshadowing
all the earth and all the
skies.</p>

<p class='c010'>With her little basket in her hand,
with her dainty step, and fluttering
muslin gown, Miss Annie brushes the
dew from the grass, as she draws near
the elm trees. But though Miss Annie
has been very confidential with
her grand-niece on the subject of her
own juvenile occupations, one little
piece of daily business Miss Annie
has forborne to tell of, and that is a
morning visit she pays to a poor pensioner
or two in the village, where, if
perhaps her charity may be sometimes
intrusive, it is always real. For
poor Miss Annie’s heart, though it
figures so much in her common talk,
and is overlaid with so many false
sentimentalities, has a true little fountain
of human kindness in it, spite of
the fantastic pretences that hide it
from common view. Absorbed with
her new thoughts, Menie neither heard
nor saw her aunt’s approach, till she
woke with a start to hear a gay laugh
behind her, and to feel the pressure
of those long thin fingers upon her
eyelids. “Dreaming, Menie? ah, my
pretty love! but not ‘in maiden meditation
fancy free.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Startled and abashed, Menie drew
back, but Miss Annie’s ringlets had
already touched her forehead, as Miss
Annie bestowed the morning salutation
upon Menie’s cheek; and now
they are seated side by side under
shadow of the greatest elm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear, I am afraid your mamma
does not encourage you to confide in
her; you must tell me all your little
trials, Menie,” said Miss Annie, fluttering
with her finger-points upon
Menie’s hand; “and now, my darling,
speak to me freely—you were delighted
to meet him last night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Menie had no voice to answer,
and could only bend down her flushed
face, and pluck up the grass with her
disengaged hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t be shy, love. I am so
much interested; and tell me, Menie,
you found him quite unchanged?—just
as devoted as he used to be? I am
sure one only needed to look at him—and
how delightful to find him quite
unchanged!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How far is it to London, aunt?”
said Menie, with confusion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So near that your thoughts have
travelled there this morning to find
him out, I know,” said Miss Annie,—“so
near that he can come out every
night, so we need not talk of London:
but come now, darling; have
you nothing to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very good,” said Menie,
with a slight falter in her voice. “I—I
should like very well to take
Jenny, if you please, to see some of
the great sights.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Annie shook her head—“Ah,
Menie, how mischievous! Don’t you
think I deserve your confidence?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, indeed, I have no confidence
to give,” said Menie, almost under
her breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear, I was just like you:
the Scotch system is so restrictive—I
was afraid to speak to any one,” said
Miss Annie; “and so you see I had
a little misunderstanding; and he was
angry, and I was angry; and first we
quarrelled, and then we sulked at each
other, and so at last it came about
that we were parted. Yes, Menie,
dear! just now you are happy; you
do not care for a sympathising heart;
but if you should chance to be disappointed—I
trust not, my love, but
such things will happen—you will then
remember that I too have been blighted—oh,
my dear child!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And with a wave of her hand,
expressing unutterable things, Miss
Annie arranged her light silken mantle
over this same blighted heart of
hers, as if to hide the wound.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Menie, whose mind already had
recovered its tone—Menie, who now
only remembered Randall unchanged,
unchangeable, towering high above
all vulgar quarrels and sullennesses,
a very fortress for a generous heart
to dwell in—Menie sprang lightly up
from the elastic turf, and stood with
her slight young figure relieved against
the morning sky, and all her frame
vibrating with pride and joy in her
worthy choice. What chance that
she should ever give this wished-for
confidence—should ever turn to seek
such sympathy—should ever find comfort
or solace in hearing of Miss Annie
Laurie’s kindred woe?</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“It is two years now since Randall
came to London. From Dumfriesshire
we send out a great many cadets into
the world, Miss Annie; and some
one who knew his father found a
situation here for Randall Home.
He brought his book with him, and it
was published, and very successful;
then he came home, and sought my
consent to his engagement with Menie.
That is all Randall’s history in connection
with us. The other young
man you expect to-night, Miss Annie,
is only a cottager’s son—very clever,
I hear, but not in any way, I fancy,
to be put in comparison with Randall
Home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Mrs Laurie took up her work
with a little quiet pride, resolved to
be very kind to Johnnie Lithgow,
but by no means pleased to have him
mentioned in the same breath with
her future son-in-law.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I adore talent,” said Miss Annie,
opening her work-table to take out a
tiny bit of “fancy” work. “I could
not describe the delight I have in the
society of people of genius—self-taught
genius too—so charming; and both
of these delightful young men must
be self-taught.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs Laurie drew herself up with a
little hauteur.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr Home has had an excellent
education; his father is a very superior
man. Johnnie Lithgow, as I
said before, is only a cottager’s
son.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Miss Annie could not see the
distinction, and ran on in such a
flutter of delight in anticipation of
her guests, that Mrs Laurie quietly
retired into the intricacies of her
work, and contented herself with a
resolution to be very kind and condescending
to the popular editor, the
cottager’s son.</p>

<p class='c010'>The drawing-room is in special
glory—the pinafores discarded from
the chairs, the little tables crowded
with gay books and toys and flowers,
and everything in its company dress.
Mrs Laurie—who never can be anything
but Mrs Laurie, a matron of
sober years, and Menie’s mother—sits,
in her grave-coloured gown and
snowy cap, upon the sofa; while on a
stool low down by her side, in a
little tremor of expectation, Miss
Annie perches like a bird, waiting the
arrival of her visitors. Mrs Laurie,
with her Dumfriesshire uses, quite
believes what Miss Annie says, that
only “a few friends” are coming to-night,
and has not the slightest idea
that the lady of the house will be
greatly mortified if her rooms are not
filled in an hour or two with a little
crowd.</p>

<p class='c010'>And up-stairs, resplendent in Jenny’s
gown, Menie Laurie stands before the
glass, fastening on one or two simple
ornaments, and admiring, with innocent
enjoyment, her unusually elegant
dress. You may guess by this glimpse
of these well-known striped skirts,
full and round, revealing themselves
under cover of the curtains, that
Jenny too has been admiring her own
magnificent purchase. But Jenny by
this time has grown impatient, and
jealous that Menie’s admiration prolongs
itself only to please her, Jenny;
so, giving premonition by sundry
restless gestures of the advent of a
“fuff,” she has turned to look out
from the window upon the sandy road
which leads to ’Eathbank.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh, Miss Menie! that brockit
ane’s a bonnie cow,” said Jenny; “I
never see onything else in this outlandish
place that minds me of hame,
if it binna the mistress and yoursel.
I’ll just bide and look out for the
young lads, Miss Menie. Ye needna
clap your hands, as if Jenny was
turning glaikit; if they werena lads
frae our ain countryside, they micht
come and gang a twelvemonth for
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the ladies and the gentlemen
will see you from the window, Jenny,”
said Menie Laurie.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ise warrant they’ve seen waur
sichts,” said Jenny briskly; “I’m no
gaun to let down my ainsel, for a’ I
<em>have</em> a thraw; and I would just like
to ken, if folk wanted to see a purposelike
lass, fit for her wark, wha they
could come to in this house but me?
There’s my lady’s maid—set her up!—in
her grand gown, as braw as my
lady; and there’s the tither slaving
creature put off a’ this morning clavering
to somebody, and no fit to be
seen now; for a’ they scoff at my
short-gown and good linsey coats.
But they may scoff till they’re tired,
for Jenny; I’m no gaun to change, at
my time of life, for a’ the giggling in
London town.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you’ll put on your gown to-night,
Jenny,” said Menie persuasively,
patting her shoulder. “There’s Randall
did not see you last time he was
here; and Johnnie Lithgow, you
would like to see him. Come, Jenny,
and put on your gown.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s no muckle Randall Home
heeds about me, and you ken that,”
said Jenny; “and for a’ he didna see
me, I saw him the last time he was
here. I’ll just tell you, Miss Menie,
yon lad, to be a richt lad, is owre
heeding about himsel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re not to say that, Jenny;
it vexes me,” said Menie, with simple
gravity; “besides, it is not true. You
mistake Randall—and then Johnnie
Lithgow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wadna say but what I micht
be pleased to get a glint of <em>him</em>,” said
Jenny. “Eh, my patience! to think
of Betty Armstrong’s son sitting down
with our mistress. But I’ll be sure
to ca’ them by their richt names afore
the folk. I canna get my tongue
about thae maisters. Maister Lithgow!
and me minds him a wee white-headed
laddie, hauding up his peeny
for cakes on the Hogmanay, and pu’ing
John Glendinning’s kailstocks at Hallowe’en.
What would I put on my
gown for, bairn? As sure as I gang
into the room, I’ll ca’ him Johnnie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Jenny’s scruples at last yielded,
and Jenny came forth from her chamber
glorious in a blue-and-yellow gown,
printed in great stripes and figures,
and made after an antediluvian fashion,
which utterly shocked and horrified
the pretty Maria, Miss Annie Laurie’s
favourite maid. Nor was Miss Annie
Laurie herself less disconcerted, when
honest Jenny, the high shoulder
largely developed by her tight-fitting
gown, and carrying a cake-basket in
her brown hands, made her appearance
in the partially filled drawing-room,
threading her way leisurely
through the guests, and examining,
with keen glances and much attention,
the faces of the masculine portion of
them. Miss Annie made a pause in
her own lively and juvenile talk, to
watch the strange figure and the keen
inquiring face, over which a shade of
bewilderment gradually crept. But
Miss Annie no longer thought it
amusing, when Jenny made an abrupt
pause before her young mistress, then
shyly endeavouring to make acquaintance
with some very fine young
ladies, daughters of Miss Annie’s loftiest
and most aristocratic friends,
and said in a startling whisper, which
all the room could hear, “Miss Menie!
ye micht tell folk which is him, if he’s
here; but I canna see a creature that’s
like Johnnie Lithgow of Kirklands,
nor ony belanging to him, in the haill
room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Annie Laurie, much horrified,
rose from her seat somewhat hastily;
but at the same moment up sprang
by her side the guest to whom her
most particular attentions had been
devoted—“And Burnside Jenny has
forgotten me!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Burnside Jenny, quite forgetful of
“all the folk,” turned round upon
him in an instant. Not quite Johnnie
Lithgow, the merriest mischief-doer in
Kirklands parish, but a face that
prompted recollections of his without
dispute—blue eyes, dancing and running
over with the light of a happy
spirit—and a wisp of close curls, not
many shades darker in colour than
those of the “white-headed laddie,”
whose merry tricks Jenny had not
forgotten. “Eh, man! is this you?”
said Jenny, with a sigh of satisfaction.
“I aye likit the callant for a’ his mischief,
and it’s just the same blythe
face after a’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall Home stood leaning his
fine figure against the mantelpiece,
and took no notice of Jenny. Randall
was somewhat afraid of a similar
recognition; but Johnnie Lithgow,
who did not affect attitudes—Johnnie
Lithgow, who was neither proud nor
ashamed of being a cottager’s son,
and who had a habit of doing such
kindly things as occurred to him without
consideration of prudence—drew
her aside by both her brown hands,
out of which Jenny had laid the cake-basket,
to talk to her of home. A
slight smile curled on the lip of Randall
Home. How well he looked,
leaning upon his arm, his lofty head
towering over every other head in
Miss Annie’s drawing-room, with his
look of conscious dignity, his intellectual
face! Menie Laurie and Menie
Laurie’s mother did not find it possible
to be other than proud of him;
yet the eyes of both turned somewhat
wistfully to the corner, to dwell upon
a face which for itself could have
charmed no one, but which beamed
and shone like sunshine upon Jenny,
greeting her as an old friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your friend is a literary man?”
said somebody inquiringly, taking up
a respectful position by Randall’s side.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, poor fellow; he spins himself
out into daily portions for the
press,” said Randall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A high vocation, sir; leader of
public opinions and movements,” said
the somebody, who professed to be
an intellectual person, a man of progress.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say rather the follower,” said
Randall; “and well for those who have
the happy knack of following wisely—chiming
in, before itself is fully aware
of it, with the humour of the time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie Laurie, who was close at
hand, and heard all this, ventured a
whisper, while Randall’s companion
had for the moment turned away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your words sound as if you
slighted him, Randall, and you too
call yourself a literary man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good Johnnie Lithgow, I like
him extremely,” said Randall, with
the half-scornful smile which puzzled
Menie; “but he is only a literary
workman after all. He does his literature
as his day’s labour—he will
tell you so himself—a mere craft for
daily bread.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And just then Lithgow turned
round, with his radiant face—he who
had no fame to lose, and did an honest
day’s work in every day, not thinking
that the nature of his craft excused
him from the natural amount of toil—and
again Menie felt a little pang at
her heart, as she thought of Randall’s
jealous guardianship of Randall’s
youthful fame.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“I have been thinking of bringing
up my mother to live with me,” said
the Mr Lithgow in whom Mrs Laurie
and her daughter were beginning to
forget the humble Johnnie: “I see no
reason why she should live in poverty
in Kirklands, while I am comfortable
here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His face flushed slightly as he concluded,
and he began to drum with
his fingers in mere shyness and embarrassment
upon Miss Annie Laurie’s
work-table. Randall, a little distance
from him, was turning over with infinite
scorn Miss Annie’s picture-books.
The two young men had grown familiar
in the house, though it was not
yet a month since they entered it
first.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I think you are very right,”
said Mrs Laurie cordially, “though
whether Mrs Lithgow might be pleased
with a town life, or whether—”</p>

<p class='c010'>She paused; it was not very easy
to say “whether your mother would
be a suitable housekeeper for you.”
Mrs Laurie could not do violence
either to her own feelings or his by
suggesting such a doubt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think it would be a great risk,”
said Randall, “and if you consulted
me, would certainly warn you against
it. Your mother knows nothing of
London—she would not like it; besides,
a young man seeking his fortune
should be alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cold doctrine,” said Lithgow,
smiling, “and to come from <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His eye fell unconsciously upon
Menie; then as he met a quick upward
glance from her, he stammered, blushed,
and stopped short—for Johnnie Lithgow
was as shy and sensitive as a girl,
and had all the reverence of youthful
genius for womanhood and love.
With compunction, and an idea that
he had been jesting profanely, Lithgow
hurriedly began again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am so vain as to think <em>I</em> myself
would be London to my mother—old
ground long known and well explored.
If she would not like the change, of
course—but I fancy she might.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I advise you against it, Lithgow,”
said Randall; “in your case I should
never entertain such an idea. There
is my father—no one can have a
greater respect for him than I—but to
bring him to live with me—to bring
him to London—I should think it the
merest folly, injurious to us both.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your wisdom is very safe at
least,” said Mrs Laurie, with a little
asperity, “since there is no chance of
your good father leaving his own
respectable house for an unknown and
strange place in any case; but I
think your wish a very natural one,
and very creditable to you, Mr Lithgow;
and whether she comes or not,
the knowledge that you wish for her
will be joy to your mother’s heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With his usual half-disdainful
smile Randall had turned away, and
there was a slight flush of anger
upon Mrs Laurie’s face. Indignation
and scorn,—there was not much hope
of friendliness where such unpromising
elements had flashed into sudden existence.
Menie, looking on with terror,
and perceiving a new obstacle thrown
into her way, hastily endeavoured to
make a diversion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know, Mr Lithgow, that
July Home is coming up to London
to see me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>There came a sudden brightening
to all the kindly lines of the young
man’s face. “July Home! if I am
too familiar, forgive me, Randall—but
I have so many boyish recollections of
her. She was such a sweet little
timid simple womanly child too. I
wonder if July minds me as I mind
her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randall stood apart still, with his
smile upon his lips. True, there had
been a momentary curve on his brow
at Lithgow’s first mention of his
sister’s name, but his face cleared immediately.
Poor little July! Randall
might know her sufficiently timid and
simple—but July was a baby, a toy,
a good-hearted kindly little fool to
her intellectual brother—and any
higher qualities sweet or womanly
about her remained to be found out
by other eyes than his.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Miss Annie has promised us
all the sight-seeing in the world,”
said Menie with forced gaiety, anxious
to talk, and to conciliate—to
remove all trace of the little breaking
of lances which had just passed. “July
and Jenny and I, we are to see all
manner of lions; and though they
will be very dull at Crofthill when
she is gone, Mr Home and Miss
Janet have consented—so next week
July is to come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor July! she will have enough
to talk of all her life after,” said her
brother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; our kindly country seems
such a waste and desert place to you
London gentlemen,” said Mrs Laurie;
“and it is wonderful, after all, how we
manage to exist—ay, even to flourish
and enjoy ourselves, in these regions
out of the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Randall made no response.
A shivering chill came over Menie
Laurie; this half-derisive silence on
one side, this eager impulse of contradiction
and opposition on the other,
smote her to the heart. It had been
rising gradually for some days past,
and Menie, without being quite aware
of it, had noticed the bias with which
her mother and her betrothed listened
and replied to each other; the unconscious
inclination of each to give an unfavourable
turn to the other’s words,
a harshness to the other’s judgment,
an air of personal offence to a differing
opinion, of grave misdemeanour
to a piece of blameless jesting. Lithgow,
stranger as he was, discovered
in a moment, so quick and sensitive
was his nature, the incipient estrangement,
and grew embarrassed and
annoyed in spite of himself—annoyed,
embarrassed, it looked so much like
the last ebullition of some domestic
quarrel; but Lithgow was a stranger,
and had no interest farther than for
the harmony of the moment in any
strife of these conflicting minds.</p>

<p class='c010'>But here sits one whose brow must
own no curve of displeasure, whose
voice must falter with no embarrassment.
She is sitting by the little
work-table in the window, her eyes,
so wistful as they have grown, so
large and full, and eloquent with
many meanings, turning from one to
the other with quick earnest glances,
which are indeed whispers of deprecation
and peace-making. “He
means something else than he says;
he is not cold-hearted nor insincere;
you mistake Randall,” say Menie’s
eyes, as they labour to meet her
mother’s, and gaze with eager perturbation
in her face, deciphering every
line and wrinkle there. “Do not
speak so—you vex my mother; but
she does not mean to be angry,” say
the same strained and ever-changing
eyes, as they turn their anxious regards
to Randall’s face. She sits between
us and the light—you can see her
girlish figure outlined against the
window—her face falling from light
to shadow, brightening up again from
shadow to light, as she turns from one
to the other; you can see how eagerly
she listens, prompt to rush forward
with her own softening gentle speech
upon the very border of the harsher
words, whose utterance she cannot
prevent. The very stoop of her head—the
changeful expression of her
face, which already interprets the end
of the sentence ere it is well begun—her
sudden introduction of one subject
after another, foreign to their former
talk—her sudden interest in things
indifferent, and all the wiles and
artifices with which she hedges off all
matters of personal or individual interest,
and abstracts the conversation
into the channel of mere curiosity, of
careless and everyday talk—are all sufficiently
visible exponents of Menie’s
new position, and new trials. She is
talking to Lithgow now so rapidly,
and with so much demonstration of
interest—you would almost fancy this
poor loving Menie had caught a contagious
enthusiasm from Miss Annie
Laurie’s juvenile delights—talking of
these sights of the great unknown
London, which have grown so indifferent
and paltry to this suddenly enlightened
and experienced mind of
hers; but in the midst of all you can
see how steadily her wakeful eyes keep
watch upon Randall yonder by Miss
Annie’s miniature book-cases, and
Mrs Laurie here, with that little angry
flush upon her brow.</p>

<p class='c010'>So slow the hours seem—so full of
opportunities of discussion—so overbrimming
with subjects on which they
are sure to differ; till Menie, in her
gradually increasing excitement, forgets
to note the progress of time;
but is so glad—oh, so glad and joyful—to
see the evening fall dark around
them, to hear Maria’s step drawing
near the door, while the lights she
carries already throw their glimmer
on the wall. It is late; and now the
visitors take leave, somewhat reluctantly,
for Lithgow begins to like his
new friends greatly; and Randall,
though something of irritation is in
the face, where his smile of disdain
still holds sway, is Menie’s ardent
wooer still, and feels a charm in her
presence, simple though he has discovered
her to be. But at last they
are gone—safely gone; and Menie,
when she has watched them from the
door, and listened to their steps till
they die away a distant echo upon
the silent air, steals away in the dark
to her own room—not for any purpose—simply
to rest herself a little;
and her manner of rest is, sitting
down upon a low stool close by the
window, where some pale moonlight
comes in faintly, and bending down
her face into her clasped hands to
weep a little, silently and alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Is it but to refresh the wistful eyes
which this night have been so busy?
is it but to wash and flood away the
pain that has been in their eager
deprecating looks, their speeches of
anxious tenderness? But Menie does
not say even to herself what it is for,
nor why. For some weeks now,
Menie has been sadly given to “crying
for nothing,” as she herself calls it.
She thinks she ought to be ashamed
of her weakness, and would be afraid
to acknowledge it to any living creature;
but somehow, for these few
days, Menie has come away about
this same hour every night into the
solitude here, to cry, with sometimes
a little impatient sob bursting out
among her tears—though she cannot
tell you, will not tell you—would not
whisper even to her own very secret
heart, the reason why.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mrs Laurie sits by the table with
her work; but it is still an easy thing
to perceive the irritation on Mrs Laurie’s
brow; her hand moves with an
additional rapidity, her breath comes
a little faster; and if you watch, you
will see the colour gradually receding
from her cheek, like an ebbing tide,
and her foot ceasing to play so impatiently
upon its supporting stool.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very humbly, like a culprit, Menie
draws forward her chair to the light.
She is admonished, ere long, by a
hasty answer, an abrupt speech, a
slight pushing back from the table,
and erection of her figure, that Mrs
Laurie is still angry. It is strange
how this cows and subdues Menie—how
eager she is to say something—how
humble her tone is—and how
difficult she feels it to find anything
to say.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poor heart! like many another bewildered
moth, Menie flutters about
the subject it behoves her most to
avoid, and cannot help making timid
allusions to their future life in London—that
future life which begins to
darken before her own vision under a
cloudy horizon of doubt and dread.
It has ceased to be a speculation now,
this future; for even within these few
days there has been talk of Menie’s
marriage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will speak of some other
thing; there is no very great charm
in the future for me, Menie,” said Mrs
Laurie, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Menie, with trembling temerity,
begs to know the reason why.
Why?—what concerns her concerns
her mother also. Very timid, yet too
bold, Menie insists, and will be satisfied—why?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because it is hard to lose my only
child,” said Mrs Laurie. “Let us not
deceive ourselves; it is easy to say
we will not be separated, that there
shall be no change. I know better,
Menie: well, well; do not cry—say
it is only the natural lot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is only the natural lot?
O mother, mother! tell me.” Menie
is still pertinacious, even through her
tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will tell you, Menie,” said Mrs
Laurie, quickly. “Randall Home
and I cannot dwell under one roof in
peace. I foresee a wretched life for
you, if we tried it; a constant struggle—a
constant failure. Menie, I will
try to be content; but your mother
feels it hard to yield up you and your
love to a stranger—very hard. I ought
to be content and submissive. I ought
to remember that it is the common
necessity—an everyday trial; but we
have been more to each other than
mere mother and daughter. I cannot
hide it from you, Menie; this trial is
very grievous to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mother! mother!” It is not “for
nothing” now that Menie Laurie weeps.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have been the light of my
eyes for twenty years—my baby, my
only bairn! I have nothing in the
world when you are gone. Menie,
have patience with your mother. I
thought we might have been one
household still. I never thought I
could have hurt my bairn by clinging
to her with all my heart. I see through
another medium now. Menie, this
that I say is better for us both. I
would lose my proper place—I would
lose even my own esteem—if I insisted,
or if I permitted you to insist,
upon our first plan. I do not mean
to insist with Randall,” said Mrs Laurie,
with a sudden flush of colour,
“but with ourselves. It is not for
your credit, any more than mine, that
your mother should be unnecessarily
humiliated; and I choose to make this
decision myself, Menie, not to have it
forced upon me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you think so—if I have nothing
to hope but this—mother, mother!”
cried Menie in her sobs, “there is yet
time; we can change it all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Menie’s voice was choked; her
head bowed down upon her folded
arms; her strength and her heart
were overcome. The room was only
partially lighted. So vacant—only
these two figures, with their little
table and their lamp at one end—it
looked lonely, silent, desolate; and
you could hear so plainly the great
struggle which Menie had with these
strong sobs and tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs Laurie wiped a few hot hasty
drops from her own eyes. She was
not much used to contest; nor was it
in her to be inflexible and stern; and
the mother could not see her child’s
distress. “Menie!” Menie can make
no answer; and Mrs Laurie rises to
go to her side, to pass a tender caressing
hand over the bowed head, to
shed back the disordered hair. “Menie,
my dear bairn, I did not mean to
vex you. I will do anything—anything,
Menie; only do not let me see
you in such grief as this.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is not what you think, mother—he
is not what you think,” cried
Menie; “it is not like this what he
says of you. O mother! I do not ask
you to do him justice—to think well
of him. I ask a greater thing of you;—mother,
hear me—I ask you to like
him for Menie’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And it will not do to evade this
petition by caresses, by soothing
words, by gentle motherly tenderness.
“Yes, Menie, my darling, I’ll try,”
said Mrs Laurie at last, with tearful
eyes. “Do you think it is pleasant
to me to be at strife with Randall?
God forbid! and him my dear bairn’s
choice; but do not look at me with
such a pitiful face. Menie, we’ll begin
again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Was Menie content? for the moment
more than content, springing up
into a wild exhilaration, a burst of
confidence and hope. But by-and-by
the conversation slackened—by-and-by
the room became quite silent, with
its dim corners, its little speck of
light, and the two figures at its farther
end. A heavy stillness brooded over
them—they forgot that they had been
talking—they forgot, each of them, that
she was not alone. The leaves stirred
faintly on the windows—the night
wind rustled past the yew-tree on the
lawn. From the other end of the
house came sometimes a stir of voices,
the sound of a closed or opened door;
but here everything was silent—as
still as if these were weird sisters,
weaving, with their monotonous moving
fingers, some charm and spell;
while, down to the depths—down,
down, as far into the chill and dark
of sad presentiment as a heart unlearned
could go—fluttering, with its
wings close upon its breast, its song
changed into a mournful cry—down
out of the serene heavens, where it
had its natural dwelling, came Menie
Laurie’s quiet heart.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Through the depth and darkness of
the summer night, you can hear Mrs
Laurie’s quiet breathing as she lies
asleep. With a pain at her heart she
lay down, and when she wakes she
will feel it, or ever she is aware that
she has awaked; but still she sleeps:
blessing on the kind oblivion which
lays all these troubles for a time to
rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>But what is this white figure erecting
itself from the pillow, sitting motionless
and silent in the night? It is
tears that keep these gentle eyelids
apart—tears that banish from them
the sleep of youth. Still, that she
may not wake the sleeper by her side,
scarcely daring to move her hand to
wipe away this heavy dew which
blinds her eyes. Menie Laurie, Menie
Laurie, can this sad watcher be you?</p>

<p class='c010'>And Menie’s soul is vexing itself
with plans and schemes, and Menie’s
heart is rising up to God in broken
snatches of prayer, constantly interrupted,
and merging into the bewilderment
of her thoughts. Startled
once for all out of the early calm, the
serene untroubled youthful life which
lies behind her in the past, Menie feels
the change very hard and sore as she
realises it; from doing nought for her
own comfort—from the loving sweet
dependence upon others, to which her
child’s heart has been accustomed—suddenly,
without pause or preparation,
to learn that all must depend
upon herself—to have the ghost of
strife and discord, where such full
harmony was wont to be—to feel the
two great loves of her nature—the
loves which heretofore, in her own
innocent and unsuspicious apprehension,
have but strengthened and deepened
each the other, set forth in antagonism,
love against love, and her
own heart the battle-ground. Shrinking
and failing one moment, longing
vainly to flee away—away anywhere
into the utmost desolation, if only it
were out of this conflict,—the next
resolving, with such strong throbs
and beatings of her heart, to take up
her burden cordially, to be ever awake
and alert, to subdue this giant difficulty
with the force of her own strong love
and ceaseless tenderness—praying now
for escape, then for endurance, and
anon breaking into silent tears over
all. Alas for Menie Laurie in her
unaccustomed solitude! and Menie
thinks, like every other Menie, that she
could have borne anything but this.</p>

<p class='c010'>But by-and-by, in spite of tears
and trouble, the natural rest steals
upon Menie—steals upon her unawares,
though she feels, in the sadness
of her heart, as if she could never rest
again; throws back her drooping head
upon her pillow, folds her arms meekly
on her breast, closes her eyelids
over the unshed tear; and thus it is
that the dawn finds her out, like a
flower overcharged and drooping with
its weight of evening dew, but wrapt
in sleep as deep and dreamless and
unbroken as if her youth had never
known a tear.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sun is full in the room when
Menie wakes, and Mrs Laurie has but
a moment since closed the door softly
behind her, that the sleeper might not
be disturbed. Even this tender precaution,
when she finds it out, chills
Menie to the heart; for heretofore
her mother’s voice has roused her,
and even her mother’s impatience of
her lingering would be joy to her to-day;
but Mrs Laurie is not impatient.
Mrs Laurie thinks it better, for all
the sun’s unceasing proclamation that
night and sleep are past, to let the
young heart refresh itself a little longer,
to leave the young form at rest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ay, Menie Laurie, kneel down by
your bedside—kneel down and pray;
it is not often that your supplications
testify themselves in outward attitude.
Now there is a murmur of an audible
voice speaking words to which no
mortal ear has any right to listen;
and your downcast face is buried in
your hands, and your tears plead with
your prayers. For you never thought
but to be happy, Menie, and the gentle
youthful nature longs and yearns for
happiness, and with the strength of a
rebel fights against the pain foreseen—poor
heart!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh, Jenny! you’re no keeping
ill-will?” said a doleful voice upon the
lawn below; very distinct, through
the open window, it quickened Menie’s
morning toilette considerably, and
drew her forward, with a wondering
face, to make sure. “I’m sure it’s no
in me to be unfriends with onybody;
and after ane coming a’ this gate for
naething but to ask a civil question,
how you a’ was. I’m saying, Jenny?
you’re no needing to haud ony correspondence
with me except ye like;
it’s the mistress and Miss Menie I’m
wanting to see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Am I to let in a’ the gaun-about
vagabones that want to see the mistress
and Miss Menie?” said Jenny’s
gruff voice in reply. “I trow no;
and how ye can have the face to look
at Jenny after your last errand till
her, I canna tell; ye’ll be for undertaking
my service ance mair? but ye
may just as weel take my word ance
for a’—the mistress canna bide ye
ony mair than me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eh, woman, Jenny, ye’re a thrawn
creature!” said Nelly Panton. “I’m
sure I never did ye an ill turn a’ my
days. But ye needna even the like of
your service to me; I’m gaun to live
with our Johnnie, and keep his house,
and Johnnie’s company are grander
folk than the mistress; but I’m no
forgetting auld friends, so I came to
ask for Miss Menie because I aye
likit her, and because she’s a young
lass like mysel; and I’ll gang and
speak to that ither servant-woman if
you’ll no tell Miss Menie I’m here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jenny’s fury—for very furious
was Jenny’s suppressed fuff at the
presumptuous notion of equality or
friendship between Menie Laurie and
Nelly Panton—was checked by this
threat; and fearful lest the dignity
of her young mistress should be injured
in the eyes of the household by
the new-comer’s pretensions, Jenny,
who had held this colloquy out of
doors, turned hastily round and pattered
away by the back entrance to open
the door for the visitor, muttering repeated
adjurations. “My patience!”
and Jenny’s patience had indeed much
reason to be called to her aid.</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie’s curiosity was a little roused—her
mind, withdrawn from herself,
lightened somewhat of its load,
and she hastened down stairs less
unwillingly than she would have
done without this interruption. Jenny
stood by the drawing-room door holding
it open; and Jenny’s sturdy little
form vibrated, every inch of it, with
anger and indignation. “Ane to
speak to you, Miss Menie!—ane
used with grand society, and owre
high for the like of me. Ye’ll have
to speak to her yoursel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Menie suddenly found herself
thrust into the room, while Jenny,
with an audible snort and fuff, remained
in possession of the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nelly Panton had too newly entered
on her dignities to be able to restrain
the ancient curtsey of her
humility. Yes, undoubtedly, it was
Nelly Panton—with the same faded
gown, the same doleful shawl, the
same wrapped-up and gloomy figure.
Against the well-lighted, well-pictured
wall of Miss Annie Laurie’s
drawing-room she stood in dingy
individuality dropping her curtsey,
while Menie, much surprised and silent,
stood before her waiting to be
addressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can nane of ye speak?” said
the impatient Jenny, from the door.
“Miss Menie, are ye no gaun to ask
what is her business here? A fule
micht ha’e kent this was nae place
to come back to, after her last errand
to Burnside; and when she kens I
canna bide her, and the mistress canna
bide her, to come and set up for a
friendship with you!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s just as cankered as she aye
was, Miss Menie,” said Nelly Panton,
compassionately, shaking her
head. “It shows an ill disposition,
indeed, when folk canna keep at
peace with me, as many a time I’ve
telt my mother. But ye see, Miss
Menie, I couldna just bide on in Kirklands
when ye were a’ away, so I
just took my fit in my hand, and
came on to London to see after
Johnnie with my ain een. He needs
somebody to keep him gaun, and set
him richt, puir callant; and he’s in a
grand way for himsel, and should be
attended to—so I think I’ll just stay
on, Miss Menie; and the first thing I
did was to come and ask for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very kind, Nelly,” said
Menie Laurie; but Menie paused
with a suppressed laugh when she
saw Jenny’s clenched hand shaken at
her from the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And ye’ll maybe think I’m no
just in condition to set up for friends
with the like of you,” said Nelly,
glancing down upon her dress; “but
I only came in to London the day before
yesterday, and I’ve naething yet
but my travelling things. I’m hearing
that little Juley Home of Braecroft’s
coming too; and between you
and me, Miss Menie, no to let it gang
ony farther, I think it was real richt
and prudent of you to show us the
first example, and draw us a’ up to
London to take care of thae lads.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean, Nelly?” exclaimed
Menie, somewhat angrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ye may weel say what does she
mean,” said Jenny, making a sudden
inroad from the door. “Do you
hear, ye evil speaker!—the mistress is
out, and there’s naebody to take care
of this puir bairn but me; whatever
malice and venom ye have to say, out
wi’t, and I’ll tell the young lady what
kind of character ye are when a’s
dune.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wadna keep such a meddling
body in my house—no, if she did the
wark twice as weel,” retorted Nelly,
with calm superiority; “and I’ve nae
call to speak my mind afore Jenny,
and her aye misca’in’ me; but it’s
nae secret of mine. I was just gaun
to say, that for a’ our Johnnie’s a
very decent lad, and minds upon his
friends, I never saw ane, gentle or
simple, sae awfu’ muckle tooken up
about himsel as Randy Home. He’s
anither lad altogether to what he
used to be; and it’s no to be thocht
but what he’s wanting a grand wife
like a’ the rest. Now, ye’ll just see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie Laurie put down Jenny’s
passionate disclaimer by a motion of
her hand. “If this was what you
came to tell me, Nelly, I fear I shall
scarcely be grateful for your visit.
Do you know that it is an impertinence
to say this to me? Whisht,
Jenny, that is enough; and I came
here to look after no one. Whatever
you may have thought before, you
will believe this now, since I say it.
Jenny will see that you are comfortable
while you stay out here; but I
think, Nelly, you have said enough to
me this morning, and I to you—Jenny,
whisht.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll no whisht,” cried Jenny, at
last, freed by Menie’s pause. “Eh, ye
evil spirit! will ye tell me what cause
of ill-will ye ever could have against
this innocent bairn? I’m no gaun to
whisht, Miss Menie—to think of her
coming up here ance errand to put
out her malice on you! My patience!
how ony mortal can thole the sicht o’
her, I dinna ken.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can forgive ye, Jenny,” said
the meek Nelly Panton, “for a’ your
passions, and your glooms, and your
ill words—I’m thankful to say I can
forgive ye; but, eh, sirs, this is a
weary world;—wherever I gang, at
hame, or away frae hame, I’m aye
miskent—naebody has the heart to
take a guid turn frae me—though,
I’m sure, I aye mean a’thing for the
best, and it was richt Miss Menie
should ken. I thocht I would just
come up this far to give ye an advice,
Miss Menie, when we were our lanes;
and I’m no gaun to blaze up into a
fuff like Jenny because it’s ill ta’en.
I’m just as guid friends as ever. The
next time I come I’ll come with our
Johnnie, so I bid you a very good
morning, Miss Menie Laurie, and
mony thanks for your kind welcome.
Jenny, fare-ye-well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Menie sat down in the window
when the dark figure of her unwelcome
visitor was gone. The sun
came in upon her gaily—the genial
August sun—and the leaves without
fluttered in a happy wind and a maze
of morning sounds, broken with shriller
shouts of children, and rings of
silvery laughter floated up and floated
round her, of themselves an atmosphere
fresh and sweet; but Menie
bowed her face between her hands,
and looked out with wistful eyes into
the future, where so many fears and
wonders had come to dwell; and vigilant
and stern the meagre yew-tree
looked in upon her, like an unkindly
fate.</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>NATIONAL GALLERY.<br> REPORT OF COMMISSION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The publication of the evidence
given before the Select Committee
on the National Gallery, enables us
to return to the subject of our article
of December with a more complete
knowledge of the facts than we could
gather from the unfinished Report and
the extracts of evidence, which the
press of the day supplied. The
whole Blue Book is a valuable document:
it contains a very clear index
by which references to all details, as
well of fact as of opinion, can be
readily made, rendering the alarming
bulk of the materials very manageable.
We can now see what each witness
actually said, so that none need complain
of partial or mutilated extracts;
every passage may be taken with its
context. We shall take occasion
thereby to correct some portions of
evidence, upon which we commented
in our former paper, having been misled
by the versions in the newspaper
reports, from which we took them.
To correct a misstatement should be
our first task. We were certainly
much surprised to find it stated that
Sir Charles Eastlake had made such
a declaration as this, that he would
not hesitate to clean a picture, and
“to <em>strip off the whole of its glazings</em>.”
We thought it at the time so improbable
that we could not believe such
to have been his meaning; and accordingly
said, that Sir Charles must
have meant coats of varnish, for that
we knew him to be too experienced a
master of his profession to mean the
glazings. We have, since the publication,
carefully examined his evidence,
and not only do not see the
words attributed to him, but collect
from his answers to the queries put
to him, a general aversion to “cleaning,”
and that, in most instances, he
opposed subjecting pictures to it, as
a dangerous process.</p>

<p class='c010'>It might, however, be supposed
that artists would agree as to the
meaning of terms of art. Those on
the Commission unacquainted with
the processes of painting, must have
been very much surprised and perplexed
by the very different meanings
given to technical terms, and that
not by one or two, or by artists of
little note, but by nearly all, including
the most celebrated. The confusion
caused by this non-agreement among
the artists, with regard to the terms
of their art, the contradictions, and
explanations, occupy a very large
portion of the Blue Book. Nor does it
appear that the Commissioners are able
to come to any clear conclusion upon
the matter. They labour hard, it
is true, and put their questions in
every shape, to learn what seems to be
simple enough—in fact, whether any
paint, put on a picture by the original
painter, in a thin transparent manner,
has been removed by the cleaning
process; but the examined force their
examiners into a labyrinth of words,
of various and tortuous uses, in which
there is all bewilderment, and no
master-clue is given them by which
they might escape into unobscured
ground. Thus, we see in the index
the word “glazings” requires four
heads of examination—1. Explanation
of the process; its susceptibility to
injury by cleaning. 2. How far it
was used by the ancient masters. 3.
Proofs of glazings having been extensively
used. 4. Removal by cleaning
of the glazings from certain pictures
in the Gallery. There is, at least, one
certain conclusion to be drawn—that
there was, and is, such a thing as
glazing. That is generally agreed
upon—in fact, is only doubted by the
keeper, Mr Uwins, R.A.; and his denial,
causing so much astonishment,
has raised a storm of contradictory
opinions, which have obfuscated the
whole artistic atmosphere. The public
attention had been drawn to a
supposed injury, said to have been
inflicted on some of the finest pictures
in the National Gallery. The attack,
through letters in the <cite>Times</cite>, on the
trustees, keeper, cleaners, and general
system, was so vigorous that the
Commission of Enquiry became absolutely
necessary, in order either to
allay the public alarm or to provide
security for the future. The result
has been certainly to justify and confirm
the alarm, and to offer certain
propositions for the better providing
for the safety and progressive improvement
of our National Gallery.
The system, which includes the whole
management of the Gallery, is condemned,
in unhesitating terms of
compliment to those who <em>made</em> the
system, and who ought to have made
a better, or to have refused position
in one so bad. Yet we really think
it is straining a point of grace to dignify
the general mismanagement with
the title of “system” at all, for no
regular system seems ever to have
been pursued from the beginning. As
we showed in our former article, (and
not from our own surmise, but from
the evidence of a parliamentary report),
our several Governments were
never in earnest with regard to the
Fine Arts; and a National Gallery
having, by a kind of accident, been
forced upon them, they chose trustees
as to an honorary office in which
there was nothing to do, selected for
their title and rank rather than for
their taste, knowledge, or ability. The
consequences have been sad indeed,
and exhibit a catalogue of sins of
commission and omission. A National
Gallery was founded thirty years ago;
what is the great production of these
thirty years of peace? It is the old
fable of the mountain’s labour. The
evidence as to losses sustained by
omission to purchase is quite vexatious;
there is a long list, to which
every one acquainted with the picture
world may make additions. We have
often and often expressed our astonishment,
when we have seen pictures
on sale, wanted in the Gallery, and not
purchased. To say nothing of the
greater schools, the Italian, less understood
by collectors of pictures, and
for which there is as yet unhappily no
sufficient public taste—How many
pictures of value, of the schools for
which a taste is professed, have been
allowed to pass away, and many of
them sent out of the country? We
allude to pictures of which there
could be no doubt, either as to their
condition or originality. For instance,
how miserably poor is our gallery in
the works of the younger Vanderveldt,
who may be almost classed as
an English painter; yet the country
had an opportunity of making a purchase
of that exceedingly fine one
sold from the collection of Sir Bethel
Codrington. How poor are we in the
works of Ruysdael, of Hobbima—painters
so highly estimated by private
collectors. We are not giving a preference
to these schools; we only
show, that what entirely falls within
the taste of all collectors among us
the nation disregards. An indifference
has been proved. Did not a
member of the Government declare,
in his place in Parliament, that it was
preferable that pictures should rather
be in private collections than in a
public gallery?</p>

<p class='c010'>We cannot subscribe to the censure
passed on our Prime-Minister, Lord
Aberdeen, by a writer in the <cite>Morning
Post</cite>, that he consented to the purchase
of two pictures which he never
saw. Surely he was justified in his
reliance upon the recommendation of
the Trustees, especially as he was well
aware of the difficulty of obtaining their
consent to make any purchases. But
the inadequacy of the system is thus
admitted. <em>Question</em> 5289.—“Your
Lordship has probably become aware
that a want of definite and well-subdivided
responsibility is the main defect
of the institution as it exists at
present?”—“Yes, I think that where
the trustees are numerous, and their
attendance is not compulsory, there is
great uncertainty; different persons
attend on different days, and come
with different views and different projects.”
But further on we have the
real cause of the difficulty exposed,
the incompetency of the judges. <em>Q.</em>
5319.—“Your Lordship is aware that
opportunities have occurred for the
purchase of pictures which belonged
to Mr Solly, Mr Conyngham, Mr
Younge Otley, and various other gentlemen;
and some persons regret that
we have not availed ourselves of those
opportunities. I presume your Lordship
conceives it might be desirable
that authority should be given to a
limited body of trustees to give a
positive recommendation in such cases
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer?”—“Yes,
I think that would be very
useful; but at the same time, on all
these subjects, people differ very much
among those who are generally supposed
to understand matters of art
exceedingly well—I have never found
two agree. In the case of pictures
not enjoying public notoriety and
celebrity, you are always liable to
that: one man will think that he has
found something that is invaluable,
while others will think that it is good
for little or nothing. You are always
liable to a difference of opinion, and
the selection must be left to those
who are admitted to be the best judges.
I do not expect to see a tribunal in
which there will not often be a great
difference of opinion on matters of
art.” Although his Lordship is aware
that there is in France, and Prussia,
and other countries, “one supreme
head, not an artist, but a nobleman
or gentleman of high attainments in
those matters, in whom the country
has confidence,” he is also aware of
the hornet’s nest that free discussion
is: in answer to question 5314, “Yes,
I believe so—a sort of minister; but
in a country where there is the same
freedom of discussion that there is
here, I should not envy the person
occupying such a position.” It would
indeed be a responsibility requiring a
strong and firm mind. And “public
confidence” is a variable thing, as
his Lordship may at the present moment
shrewdly suspect; yet we doubt
not there would be many candidates
for, or at least many having sufficient
confidence in themselves to accept,
such a position. Such might be found
amongst the competent and incompetent.
It is not improbable that Mr
Morris Moore, fully assured of his own
taste and knowledge, would accept it;
or if Sidney Smith were living, he
would be likely to add that to the catalogue
of undertakings to which Lord
John Russell would think himself fully
equal, even though there would be a
chance of being flayed alive by public
discussion and averted public confidence.
There are men who desperately
love to give judgment <i><span lang="la">ex cathedra</span></i>,
whether it be about a Titian or
a nation’s safety, and would hardly be
restrained though the fate of Sisanes
were threatened them, and they were
to encounter the chance of being flayed,
and their skins made cushions for
their successors in the same seat, to
remind them of the consequences of
an ill judgment. Still we advocate
the one supreme head—a minister of
the fine arts—and would have him
choose his council; nor should we be
so unreasonable as to expect even
such a one to be a competent judge in
all departments. Few, indeed, are so
gifted. Sir Robert Peel, who appears
from the beginning to have taken
great interest in the Gallery, would
scarcely have been a competent authority
with regard to Italian art; for, if
we mistake not, in the public exhibition
of his pictures, a few years ago,
there were none of any of the Italian
schools. We know no man whose
general judgment we should so much
rely upon as Sir Charles Eastlake, for
he is accomplished, not only as a
painter, but as a scholar of artistic
research, and full of knowledge; but
we learn from himself, in his evidence
before this Commission, that when he
was appointed to the keepership by
Sir Robert Peel, he accepted the office
on the condition that he was only to be
consulted on, and responsible for, the
purchase of Italian pictures. A minister
of fine arts should certainly be
well acquainted with the finest works
of art, and they are undoubtedly of
the Italian schools—a real knowledge
of these, to a great extent, implies a
Catholic taste. The possessor of such
knowledge is not likely to be blind to
the merits of other schools, though
his preference for the higher may have
limited his search, and in some measure
lowered his zeal as a collector.
He would, of course, have subordinate
officials, who would, for final judgment,
refer to him; and we should in
no case fear his decision if he were
versed in the fundamental principles
of art discoverable in the great schools
of Italy. There should be purveyors
everywhere. But we have seen enough
in the pages of the Report to show that
such employed purveyors should not
be selected from picture-dealers. Any
one attached to the Gallery in this
capacity should be a sworn agent,
bound to renounce all picture-dealing
as a trade, and not to accept anything
whatever in the shape of commission.
We see no reason why he should ever
have been in the trade at all, quite
sure that there are many gentlemen
out of it perfectly qualified to undertake
the important duty.</p>

<p class='c010'>The main object of the Commission
being to discover if the charges of
injury, from cleaning certain pictures,
have any foundation, it may be
thought somewhat strange that they
scarcely come to a conclusion upon
the matter, which, if they had been
inclined to trust to their perception,
would not have been a difficult task.
They tell us that “the preponderance
of testimony is to the effect, that the
appearance of the pictures has been
<em>rendered less agreeable by the operation
of cleaning</em> (the draught of Report
says deteriorated)—in some of
them, in regard to their general aspect,
by removal of the mellow tone
which they previously exhibited; in
others, from special blemishes, which
have become apparent, and which in
a former state of the pictures were
not perceptible.” In another place
we are told, “the weight of evidence
varies considerably in respect of the
effect produced upon each of the nine
pictures which have been lately subjected
to the process of cleaning.”
We should have thought the <em>weight</em>
of evidence had been the <em>preponderance</em>;
the weighing down testimony,
the turning the scale for or against a
varying weight, as a conclusion of
evidence appears rather unintelligible.
There never was so great a weight of
evidence as the Blue Book itself.
Did the Commissioners—admitting
that, from the examination of artists,
amateurs, and picture-dealers, the
only result was “great contrariety
of judgment and irreconcilable differences
of taste”—go to the pictures and
examine for themselves? They did
so. They went “in company with
several witnesses, and in some instances
they had also the advantage
of engravings and painted sketches of
the pictures, so that the witness could
point out in detail the precise grounds
upon which his conclusions were
founded.” We did expect, when we
came upon this passage in the Report,
that we should learn what the Commissioners
themselves thought after
this inspection, especially as they had
immediately stated that the object of
the inspection was, “<em>in order that
every facility</em> might be afforded for
<em>the elucidation of these conflicting</em> opinions.”
But, no. They avoid throwing
any opinion into the scale; so
that there is no positive decision;
and at this interesting point they suddenly
turn aside, make, as it were, a
ring, to enjoy the stand-up fight of
the conflicting opinions of Mr Morris
Moore and Mr Uwins the keeper,
as some relief to the discrepancies
among themselves. We do not doubt
that they did form a judgment in their
own minds, and can readily guess it.
They are cautious, and avoid pronouncing
it. Indeed, the Commissioners
seem to have been a little
vexed with Mr Morris Moore, and
look unpleasantly upon him as a chief
accuser who had put into their hands
a very disagreeable work, which they
do not at all sit easy under. They
show their vexation in the Report,
p. xi., where, in commenting upon the
contradictory evidence of Mr Morris
Moore and Mr Uwins, they embody
in the Report the opinion of Mr
Uwins, who characterises the evidence
of Mr M. Moore as “displaying
a mass of ignorance and want of
intelligence.” And immediately, as if
to set aside the evidence of both, we
presume by the context as prejudiced,
they say—“Your Committee wish to
direct attention to the <em>unprejudiced</em>
[the italics are ours] opinions of many
eminent artists and amateurs.” So
when Mr Morris Moore justly complains
of insult from the unreproved
words used by Mr Farrer, “If the
imputation came from a person who
I thought would be believed, I should
take it up,” the Commissioners, after
clearing the room to consider the
charge of Mr Moore, that he had been
insulted, came to the strange conclusion,
not that Mr Farrer’s words were
no insult, but that “Mr Moore had
himself frequently used language towards
others which might reasonably
give offence.” Now this is not fair.
Offence may be given reasonably, and
therefore admissibly; but when it is
of a nature to impugn the veracity
generally, not as to any particular fact,
of a person under examination, as one
not to be believed, he has a right to
demand protection; and if it be not
given, their right of examination ceases.
There is a great difference between
what may be in the nature of the evidence
offensive and what is insulting.
If Mr Moore had been equally guilty
with Mr Farrer, the Commissioners
should, when so guilty, have reproved
it; whereas they make this their
omission an excuse for not doing
plain justice now. Doubtless Mr M.
Moore has given great offence by his
evidence, but that does not justify Mr
Farrer in offering an insult which is
not evidence; nor are the Commissioners
justified in their comment that
Mr Moore had given offence, without
marking still more strongly the insult
offered by Mr Farrer, still unreproved.
We are not acquainted with Mr
Moore, nor do we in any way take
up his “<em>animosities</em>,” if he has any;
but we think towards him the Commissioners
did not act quite fairly,
nor consistently with the dignity of
their position.</p>

<p class='c010'>We may not unaptly look upon
their visit to the National Gallery as
an inquest on the bodies of certain old
masters—say Claude, Titian, Velasquez—for
the charge had been made
of positive murder. The decision required—Were
they dead, killed, murdered,
or still alive and well-looking?
A physician once told us an anecdote
in point. He, with another physician,
had been some time in attendance
upon a patient. (We believe
the man was a baker). One day they
went up-stairs as usual, looked a
moment or two at the poor man, then
at each other significantly, and walked
out of the room. On the stairs they
met the wife, and tenderly informed
her that she was a widow; and as a
widow she properly conducted herself,
and saw the physicians depart.
It so happened that our friend, some
weeks after, turning the corner of a
street, came suddenly against the
baker—“What! aren’t you dead?”
“No,” said the man, “I recovered as
soon as you left me.” A little farther
on he met the widow that should have
been. Perhaps she had less reason
to be thankful than her recovered husband.
She raised a tumult against
the physician, vociferating, “Pretty
fellows you must be—much you must
know of your business, not to know
whether a man be living or dead.”
From this, he said, he determined
henceforth, on most occasions, to use
only dumb show, or ambiguous expressions.
The Commissioners seem to
have been of this way of thinking.
They cannot altogether acquit the irresponsible
responsibles—are unwilling
to condemn; they adopt, therefore,
a figure not unknown in oratory, a
mystification under the ambiguity of
a varying weight of evidence.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c008'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>We are, however, now in a position
to hear the witnesses speak for
themselves. Such a mass of contradictions
it will be difficult to find elsewhere
among professors of any other
art or science. In the multitude of
counsellors there may be wisdom, but
it is not the less hard to extract it;
and certainly one part of the wisdom
is sometimes to conceal it.</p>

<p class='c010'>As “glazing” has been shown to be
a fertile source of discrepancies of
opinion, and the whole question of
the cleaning process so much depends
upon its existence or non-existence
in certain works, and upon its peculiar
liability to injury, it may not be
unimportant to examine the testimonies
concerning it.</p>

<p class='c010'>What is the definition of glazing?
Sir Charles Eastlake makes it to be,
“The passing a dark transparent
colour over a lighter colour.” He also
draws a distinction between the Italian
and Flemish glazing. “The Italian
practice is glazing over a solid, light
preparation; the Flemish is passing
transparent colours over a light
ground.” Mr Charteris doubts the
propriety of the definition; Sir Charles
explains, “I would say that, if a
dark transparent colour be passed too
thickly, even over a white ground, so
as to exclude the light entirely, it becomes
opaque; on the other hand, if
an opaque colour be passed so thinly
over a light ground as to show the
light through, it partakes of the nature
of glazing. There are pictures
by Rubens, in which some of the
tints are produced in that way, with
opaque colour in a diaphanous state.
I was about to state, when you called
my attention to the meaning you
attach to glazing, that the system of
passing a thin opaque colour over its
ground is called, in English technical
phraseology, ‘scumbling;’ and the
passing a strictly transparent colour
over its ground is called ‘glazing.’” It
may appear very bold in us to question
this definition of the President of the
Academy; yet we are inclined to do
so, because we think our artists have
not agreed to adopt it, and because it
leaves a common mode of painting
without any technical term; but if
scumbling may be allowed to express
the thin, yet somewhat dry, rubbing
in of opaque colour, we may well
leave glazing to the conception of it
adopted by the Italians, which strikes
Sir Charles Eastlake as remarkable.
“Now, it is remarkable that the
Italians have but one word for both
operations—the term <i><span lang="it">velare</span></i> (to veil)
comprehends both glazing and scumbling.”
Nor do we see any sufficient
reason for confining glazing to dark
over light. We cannot but think it
was the practice of the Italian schools,
at least some of them, to paint glazingly
light over dark. Did not Correggio,
especially in his backgrounds,
paint out the light, the white ground—if
he used always light grounds—with
deep greys, not of a uniform tone, and
afterwards go over them, sometimes
with dark transparent colour, and
sometimes semi-transparent, and so
on lighter? The practice of Rembrandt
seems to want technical terms,
if Sir Charles’s definition is to be an
authority. That eminent painter of
mysterious effect, of “palpable obscure,”
certainly often painted glazingly
semi-opaque lighter over dark,
as well as dark over light. It may
be a question of practical art, if it
be not as desirable that dark under-painting
should come out, or slightly
appear through a lighter, as that light
should come up through the dark.
We never can be brought to believe
that a white ground, showing through
dark glazings, will imitate all the
depths of nature. It was perhaps too
much the practice of the Flemish
schools, but they were not schools
from which we should learn the power
of sentiment in colouring. It was an
expeditious practice, but it led to a
conventional colouring, sacrificing the
truth of shadows, with the object (if
attained) of setting off, and giving
body to the lights. We the rather
dwell upon this, because we believe
that the Flemish system, and particularly
that of Rubens, has had an
injurious influence upon modern art.
Rubens was a painter of great power,
and dared an extravagance of conventionality,
which, in weaker hands,
becomes a conspicuous fault. Hence
a thin, flashy, and flimsy style of
painting, unnatural, because unsubstantial;—we
say unsubstantial; for,
however illuminated, or covered with
transparency of light or of shadow,
nature is ever substantial. The Italian
practice is, therefore, greatly to
be preferred.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is well known that our Gainsborough
said, that with black or blue,
and asphaltum, he would make a pit
as deep as the Inferno; but it was a
mistake: with such dark transparency,
especially over a light ground,
he would make no pit at all, but a
hole scarcely the depth of his mall-stick;
his arm could reach to the end
of it, as against a wall. In the greatest
depths of nature, there is a depth
of dark below, not of light, over which
there is atmosphere. It is this depth
that should come up, not light. We
are not unaware that any semi-opaque
glazing over a darker colour has a
tendency to coldness, but it may not
be the worse on that account, as the
painter has the choice of making his
under-darks as warm as he pleases,
and his semi-opaque glazing warm
too. This, cool, in its various degrees
over warm, was the method adopted
by both the Poussins: they painted
on red ground, and that generally not
light, but of deep tone; as it was
also pretty much the case with the
Bolognese school. Gaspar Poussin,
by this method, gave great effect to
his cool greens in masses of wood,
the red ground imperceptibly giving
an under warmth, the general masses
being laid in with a body of colour,
but semi-transparent, as if chalk,
or some transparent body, had been
embodied with the colour. In his
pictures, cool greys, more or less
mixed with ochres, tell with great
truth over the red ground. We hope
the condemnation passed by the
President of the Academy upon this
method may not be quite merited.
Indeed, the beauty of most of that
great, we should say greatest, of
landscape-painter’s works, which are
yet uninjured by the cleaner, would
contradict so strong an assertion, as
that they are sure to perish from the
cause ascribed; for, as they have survived
at least two hundred years,
Gaspar Poussin having been born in
1600, (and, it may be worth observing,
Claude in the same year), we
may fairly presume that the work of
time on white lead has already done
its worst; and we would almost doubt
the effect ascribed to time, when we
look at the perfect pictures of the
master, which appear as if fresh from
the easel, and certainly the white not
too transparent. Sir Charles is explaining
why he objected to the cleaning
certain pictures. “The general
reason I have given; but if you were
to ask me about those pictures, I
should say of the two, Canaletti and
the Poussin, that it is extremely
injudicious to clean pictures of that
kind, because time, even without any
assistance from picture-cleaners, is
sure to destroy such pictures in the
end; they are painted on a dark
ground, and every painter knows,
that when white lead is thinly spread
over a dark colour, it becomes more
or less transparent in time: white
lead has a tendency to grow transparent.
If you were to paint a chess-board
with a thin coat of white lead,
so as effectually to conceal the black
squares, and not suffer it to be touched,
in a certain time, longer or shorter,
according to the thinness of the paint,
the black squares would again become
apparent. The white lead has a tendency
to grow transparent, and the
consequence is, that, when a picture is
painted on a dark ground, time does
it harm rather than good.” We
would, with some hesitation—for we
pay great deference to the opinions of
Sir C. Eastlake—suggest another cause
for this appearance of the chess-board—the
tendency of oil to become a varnish,
and therefore itself more transparent;
and we are inclined to think
that, had the experiment been tried
with any other colour, ochres, or
Naples yellow, the effect would have
been the same. Nay, what would be
a still better test—had the whole board
been covered with black, the white
squares, we believe, though concealed
for a time, would have appeared
through. We also hope and trust
that this effect of time on the oil is
on the whole rather beneficial than
otherwise, and that it is not continuous
beyond a certain point. It is almost
incredible that either the oil or the
white lead, laid on canvass two or
three hundred years ago, is now, at
the present, and will be in future, to
a day of destruction, changing their
properties. Then, with regard to
Gaspar Poussin, if such were really
the case, the lights would be the first
to disappear; but, on the contrary, Mr
Brown, who cleaned the Dido and
Æneas about thirty years ago, a very
dark picture, gives another kind of
evidence. <em>Q.</em> 1128.—“Did you observe
in that picture that a very
considerable part of the discolouring
and blackness arose from internal
causes, from an internal alteration in
the colours?”—“In some instances;
but the general effect of the picture
was very much lowered by the heterogeneous
mass of oil that was upon it,
and the very dark parts did not, of
course, come out, as you would imagine
they would, from the removal of
that: the lighter parts were very
brilliant, indeed, but it was always
a dark picture.” <em>Q.</em> 1130.—“Is
there not something peculiar in the
ground on which Gaspar and Nicholas
Poussin painted their pictures, which
rendered them liable to decomposition
and discolourment?”—“I think not so
much the ground, as the colour which
they would put upon the ground,
because the ground that you see in
those masters, where they have used
it to assist them in painting the picture,
is an universal colour: in some
parts of the picture, the ground is
more or less painted on, but all the
light parts of Gaspar Poussin’s pictures
are very tender.” The differences
of opinion with respect to glazing
are chiefly among the artists. Picture-cleaners
and picture-dealers are
in better agreement. Even the artists
who differ, perhaps differ more on
account of the definition not being
very clear, and established in the
artists’ vocabulary, than as to the
fact. But the evidence of the present
keeper, Mr Uwins, is certainly very
extraordinary on this, as on every
point upon which his examination
entered. We showed, in our last
paper, how he was present and absent
at the cleanings at the same times;
how he gave evidence as to the
methods adopted by the cleaners in
his presence, which the cleaners themselves
very flatly contradicted; how
he astonished Lord Monteagle by
assertions which his lordship denied;
how he protested he did not advise,
yet did advise; and now we find,
with regard to this question of glazing,
having contradicted nearly every one
else, he turns round, for lack of others,
to contradict himself. His first answers
about glazing were most plain
and unhesitating. Being asked if the
Venetian painters did not use glazing,
and that, in consequence, their pictures
are liable to injury in cleaning,
he says, “That is a question that can
never be settled, because nobody can
prove that they did use glazings.”
<em>Q.</em> 116.—“Is it your opinion that
they did, or that they did not?”—“I
believe that the best painters of
every school used very little, indeed,
if any at all, of what is called glazing.
I think it quite a modern quackery,
that has nothing to do with the noble
works of remote ages in art.” <em>Q.</em>
117.—“You consider the theory,
as to the Venetian painters having
used very delicate glazings in finishing
off their pictures, is fallacious?”—“I
do not admit those glazings, as they
are called; I believe that they sought
for freshness and pureness of colour,
and depended on their knowledge of
colour for the harmony of their picture,
and not on putting on what the
Romans call ‘la velatura Inglese;’
they wished to obtain the vigour and
freshness of nature, or their pictures
would not have lasted as they have.”
<em>Q.</em> 118.—“Will you explain to the
Committee why the Romans (I presume
you mean the Romans of the present
day) call that particular process
by the name of ‘la velatura Inglese?’”—“Because
the English painters only
adopt it.” <em>Q.</em> 119.—“The English
painters of the modern school?”—“It
is only those who adopt it; that is why
it is especially called ‘la velatura Inglese.’”
This is very childish, to attempt
to disprove the practice of the
old Roman, or other masters, by the
supposed—for it is only supposed—or
assumed criticism of modern Romans,
who can be no authority upon the practice
of modern art in this country.
Having found, however, that “velare”
and “velatura” are old, not new
terms of art, in another examination
Mr Uwins comes to his explanation,
which is as extraordinary as his first
assertion. He contradicts himself,
by admitting, that all good painters
did use glazings, and even asserts that
he never denied it, only in a particular
sense. It is in vain that the Committee
tell him, they asked not the
question in any particular sense; he
slips out of the hands of the examiner
with wonderful lubricity. It is the
hardest thing to bring his comprehension
to any sense whatever of the
questions put to him; and as to the
unfortunate “velatura,” he has examined
the dictionary of the Academy
of Bologna, and, although he has
admitted its meaning by the thing,
as in practice they all glazed, yet, not
to be vanquished, even by his extracts
from his dictionary, he pertinaciously
says, “I believe that both these
extracts relate to the preparation of
the canvass.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We fear the reader may be weary
of this discussion on glazing, but we
must beg him to go a little further
with us on the subject; it is important,
for if there were no glazings,
both during the process and final, no
damage may have been done, in respect
to them, for there could be none
to remove—a state of the case which
some would fain establish, if possible.
The Committee take a great deal of
trouble to get the clearest evidence
upon the point. We perfectly agree
with Mr Morris Moore in his evidence
in this matter, and utterly repudiate
the idea that the mellow, warm, lucid
tones of the old masters have been in
any degree given by time. He very
appositely quotes the sensible Hogarth,
“Time cannot give a picture more
union and harmony than has been in
the power of a skilful master, with all
his rules of art, to do.” Mr Morris
Moore denies it, with the examples of
Claude and Titian, and quotes amply
old authorities. We have immediately
referred to Leonardo da Vinci’s treatise
on painting in general, a very puzzling
book; but we find a passage which
shows that not only tone might be
given by glazing, but colours changed
by it—that is, one colour over another,
making a third. He says, “A transparent
colour being laid on another
colour of a different kind forms a third,
partaking of each of the two simples
that compose it.” Mr Dyce, R.A.,
comes to the rescue of the Paul
Veronese, one of the recently cleaned
pictures, showing from the authority
of Boschini, a satirical writer on
art, of the seventeenth century, that
Paul Veronese did not glaze his
draperies. The conclusion would of
course be, that in that respect the
picture could not have been injured,
or that it is not the work of Paul
Veronese. But surely the passage
from Boschini proves too much; for
it asserts with regard to drapery an
impossibility, or at best a very unlikely
thing, unless glazing be taken
into the account. For though Boschini
is made to say, that Paul Veronese
never glazed his drapery, he is made
also to say that “he was accustomed
to paint the shadows of drapery with
lake, not only of red draperies, but
also of yellow, green, and even blue,
thus producing an indescribably harmonious
effect.” But he had also
said, that the painter “put in the
local tints of draperies first, painting
the blue draperies for the most part
in water-colour.” It is, in the first
place, most unlikely that he left these
draperies in water-colour only; it is
more probable that this first painting
was entirely gone over, or his lake in
shadows would hardly have suited
all the colours. We happen to have
in our possession a Venetian picture,
which shows this Venetian practice
of lake, under blue drapery. It is
a Palma; the subject, The Dead
Christ, The Virgin Mother, Mary
Magdalene, and other figures. The
foot of Mary the Mother rests on a
stone, on which is written Jacobus
Palma. He was the pupil of Titian,
and is said to have finished a picture
left unfinished by Titian. The lake
is very visible under the blue, which
was evidently put over it; and being
rubbed off here and there, the red is
very conspicuous. We mention this,
merely to show that so far Boschini
was right, and that the practice was
not confined to Paul Veronese. And
is there not presumption in any one,
whether painter or not—and Boschini
was no painter, or a poor one—to
assert positively, that a master who
lived a generation before him did not
use this or that process of painting,
having a choice of all, and skill to use
them. Boschini’s aversion was the
abuse of varnishes; and it is curious
that, among the condemned recipes is
the <i><span lang="it">olio d’abezzo</span></i>, for which there are
other authorities besides Armenini,
and it is mentioned in the Marciana
Manuscript, supposed to have been
the varnish of Correggio. Boschini
is speaking of <em>foreigners</em>, “forestiere,”
not Venetians:—</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Dyce is unfortunate upon one
occasion in rejecting the evidence of
Armenini, “because he describes the
practice of another school,” “his own
school, the school of Ferrara.” Upon
this Mr Morris Moore is somewhat
sharp upon him, and quotes Armenini
himself, to show that he does not confine
himself to any school, but speaks
from the “practice and example of
the most excellent artists that have
existed,” and that he was of Faenza,
not Ferrara.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs Merrifield, in her valuable
work on the ancient practice of painting,
the result of a Government Commission,
expresses great confidence in
the information she received from a
learned and skilful Milanese painter
and cleaner, Signor A. He had particularly
studied the works of Titian,
and describes his practice. If his
account be correct, Titian certainly
glazed over his lights as well as darks;
and, like Paul Veronese, by the account
of Boschini, he painted the
shadows of blue drapery with lake.
“He (Titian) then painted the lights
with flesh-colour, and laid by the
picture to dry. After five or six
months he glazed the flesh with <i><span lang="it">terra
rossa</span></i>, and let it dry. He then painted
in the shades transparently (that is
without any white in the shadows),
using a great deal of asphaltum<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c008'><sup>[5]</sup></a> with
them.” “He also said, that in a blue
drapery he painted the shades with
lake, and then laid on the lights (with
white); that these colours were laid
on with great body, and, when dry,
he took a large brush and spread the
biadetto over the whole.” This biadetto
was used by Paul Veronese; we
suppose it was a blue from copper,
and, owing to its liability to turn
green, used without oil. Now, if
such was the practice of Titian, it was
most likely in some degree the practice
also of Paul Veronese, who,
though younger, was contemporary
with Titian. We somewhat enlarge
upon this question here, because, by the
evidence given, doubts were thrown
upon the originality of the “Consecration
of St Nicolas,” or to prove that
no glazings had been removed.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall not pursue this subject
further, concluding that, whatever
practice is in use now by various
artists was known by the ancient
masters, and some things more, which
are either lost or uncertainly recovered.
No one has paid greater
attention to this subject, or applied to
it more research and discrimination,
than Sir Charles Eastlake. We still
look for more valuable and decisive
information from him, especially with
respect to the Italian schools.</p>

<p class='c010'>We are certainly surprised at the
opinions given by artists of eminence
as to the condition of the Claude,
“The Queen of Sheba;” that Mr
Stansfield should confirm his opinion
of its being uninjured “from the extremities
of the trees next the sky,
and the foliage generally,” because
those very parts have appeared to
our eyes so feeble, so washy, as if at
some time or other painted on by another
hand than Claude’s: we say the
same also, somewhat fearlessly, of the
edges of the trees in the small upright
Claude. The outlining, too, of
the cloud in the Queen of Sheba is
of the same feeble handling; and the
upper and lower tones of the sky are
quite out of agreement. Mr Stansfield
and others think time will restore the
lost tone and harmony: we cannot
comprehend this judgment. If time
can give that peculiar warm glow of
Claude, we should see that time had
done this kind or unkind office on the
works of other painters, as cold as
that picture is now. There were
many who avoided this glow, as unsuited
to their subjects; we do not
see that time has in this respect converted
any of them into Claudes.
There is Claude’s imitator, Swannevelt,
without the glow; but take
Ruysdael, who painted upon an opposite
principle—we never see that
glow thrown over his pictures. His
fresh blue and white skies are still
free from that yellow toning of time’s
fingers. It comes to this—either
Claude painted his peculiar glow, or
time did for him. If Time did it for
him, Time must have been constrained
by his office and nature to do the
same thing for others. He did not
do so for others, or Claude’s would
not be a glow peculiar to him—<em>ergo</em>,
Claude did the work, and not time.
But time is also supposed to do this
ameliorating work very speedily. Mr
Stansfield thinks “we all must allow
that the Cuyp has recovered its tone.”
Will it be allowed? There is, and
was after the cleaning of that picture
in 1844, a pink colouring in the sky,
which put the whole picture out of
harmony, which, if painted by Cuyp,
to be like his other works, could only
have been an under-tone, and by him
gone over with another, which must
have been at some time or other removed.</p>

<p class='c010'>How could so skilful a marine
painter as Mr Stansfield look accurately
at the water from the foreground
to the distance in the Claude
and think it uninjured? The very
forms of the waves, in the second and
third distances, are interrupted and
faint. An argument has been brought,
that, if the sky had been injured, the
ropes would have suffered. Besides
that it is merely assumed that they
have not suffered, that argument is
fallacious. We have the authority of
a very experienced picture-cleaner,
and one well acquainted with pictures
and all processes, which tends to a
contrary proof. De Burtin, in his
treatise on picture-cleaning, says:
“A point of the utmost importance,
and which never must be lost sight of,
is this, that among the glazings there
will be found some which, although
very transparent and delicate, it is
nevertheless very difficult to injure,
because they have been laid on the
colour when fresh, and have become
thoroughly incorporated and united
therewith; and, on the contrary, there
will be found others, and sometimes
not so transparent and delicate, but
which will yet be injured very readily,
because they stand separate from, and
do not adhere to the colour beneath
them, that having been almost dry
ere they were put on.” Now, supposing
that Claude’s glow were—we
say not that it was—an after-glaze,
the ropes may have been put in on
the wet sky. Does any one think
that Claude’s skies were painted at
one painting, or even two?</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Stansfield had used the words
“raw and disagreeable;” but being
asked if he thought that picture
raw and disagreeable when it left
Claude’s easel? replies, No. We
must in justice say, that he somewhat
modifies the expression. “Perhaps I
have used a wrong term in saying
‘raw’ and ‘disagreeable,’ for we
all paint for time to have some effect
upon our pictures.” Notwithstanding
Mr Stansfield’s great experience, we
more than doubt this fallacy as to
time. We know it to be, and to have
been, a favourite maxim of many
painters of the English school, that
time will remedy rawness, and make
their works in mellowness what those
of the ancient masters were. We
utterly disbelieve it, and for the following
reasons: It is out of character
with the mind of genius purposely to
leave a work incomplete. The idea
of perfection being in the mind, the
hand cannot resist the operation.
Then, has time had that effect upon
more modern works? We appeal for
evidence to the Vernon Gallery. Are
the pictures there better than when
they were fresh from the easel? Not
one, we verily believe, and <em>know</em> some
to be much worse. This was a notion
of Constable’s and his followers, and
it has infected the minds of too many.
He painted as if he would frost his
pictures with white—has time finished
them to his conceived perfection?
Those who trust to time must, we
fear, also trust to the picture-cleaner
and picture-toner, against whom there
is, rather inconsistently, a considerable
outcry. This is a point not requiring
a test of long ages. Mr Stansfield
himself thinks “The Queen of Sheba”
will recover its tone in six months,
and that from 1846 to the present
time the satisfactory change has
taken place in the pictures cleaned.</p>

<p class='c010'>With regard to Claude’s general
yellow tone, there remains yet a question
to be asked—Did he take it from
nature, or did he add it with a view
of improving nature? Quite aware
that the question will shock the Naturalists,
we still venture it. In the
first place, be it observed—and we have
noticed it elsewhere in the pages of
this Magazine—nature will bear great
liberties with regard to colour, without
losing her characteristics. Colour
may be said, in this sense, to be the
poetical language of nature. It is
astonishing that any can doubt whether
or not this view of nature was
taken by the Ancient Masters. It is
unfashionable now. To apply this
to Claude: In Sir David Brewster’s
evidence, we find mention made of
“Claude glasses,” some of which he
produced. He considered that, looking
through these, the tone would be
much restored to the eye. “I conceive,”
he says, “this (the yellow
tone) is proved by the glasses, which
I have produced, having got the name
of Claude Lorraine glasses from their
giving that general tone to nature
that characterises all his pictures.”
This leads to a slight discussion on
the subject of the glasses. Mr B.
Wall asks Sir David, “Are you not
aware that, about forty-five years
ago, those Claude Lorraine glasses
were introduced and sold, three, or
four, or five together, and they were
very much used by tourists who used
to see the English Lakes?—were they
not of different colours—blue, pink,
green, and almost every shade?”
“No such name was given to such
glasses as you refer to in your question.”
Mr B. Wall: “I venture to
differ from your high authority, and
to think that the glass which you call
a Claude Lorraine glass is not the
only glass that went by that name;
and therefore that the inference
which you have drawn, that the yellow
one was the proper one to use
when you looked at Claude’s pictures,
was not correct.” Mr Stirling asks
if there is not another thing called
a Claude Lorraine glass, “a piece of
coloured glass which is used to reduce
the landscape, and reflect it like the
surface of a mirror?” Sir David says,
he never saw it done with coloured
glass. The difference between the
glass spoken of by Sir David, and
that by Mr B. Wall, does not seem
very important,—it being that one
admits other colours more freely than
the other. Mr Wall is not, however,
quite correct in limiting the invention
to forty-five years ago. We have
one in our possession which we know
to have been in existence very near a
century, and it has always been called
a Claude glass. I believe it has been
in use, as was the black glass, in the
days of the Old Masters. The effect
on the natural landscape is curious,
and worth recording. The yellow
glass is very extraordinary: it wondrously
heightens the lights, so that
a sky, for instance, in which scarcely
an illuminated cloud is seen, looked
at through this glass, exhibits great
variety of parts. Shadows are deepened,
and light strengthened; real
colours not lost, but as it were covered
with a glaze. We have always
been of opinion that Rembrandt used
it, his pictures are so like nature seen
through that medium. It mostly reduces
the blue, making it greenish.
There was a little picture of Rembrandt
exhibited some years ago at
the Institution in Pall-Mall, which
presented exactly the effect we speak
of. It was a most simple subject—a
hilly ground, on the undulating summit
of which, on one side, was a
village church among trees, on the
other a few scattered houses, all dark,
against the sky; from the division of
the hill, a road very indistinct came
down to the foreground, which, to the
right, melted off into a dark brook,
going into deep shade, where it was
lost. The sky was exceedingly luminous—a
cloud rising over the village,
such as would “drop fatness,” and
the whole tone of that greenish-grey,
with rich-toned illuminations, which
the Claude glass constantly presents
to the eye. In a paper of this Magazine
of 1847, in which we had occasion
to speak of colour, and the habit
of the Old Masters in deviating from
the common, obvious colouring of
nature, we alluded to this Claude
Lorraine glass. “This may be exemplified
by a dark mirror—and,
better still, by a Claude glass, as it
is called, by which we look at nature
through coloured glasses. We do not
the less recognise nature—nay, it is
impossible not to be charmed with
the difference, and yet not for a moment
question the truth. We are
not here discussing the propriety of
using such glasses—it may be right,
or it may be wrong, according to the
purpose the painter may have. We
only mean to assert, that nature will
bear the changes and not offend any
sense. The absolute naturalness,
then, of the colours of nature, in its
strictest and most limited sense, local
and aërial, is not so necessary as that
the eye cannot be gratified without
it. And it follows, that agreeability
of colour does not depend upon this
strict naturalness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We learn from Mrs Merrifield, that
Signor A. showed her a black mirror,
which had belonged to Bamboccio
(Peter Van Laer). “This mirror
was bequeathed by Bamboccio to
Gaspar Poussin; by the latter to
some other painter, until it ultimately
came into the hands of Signor A.” It
is admitted by Mr Seguier himself,
as by other witnesses, that Claude
painted thinly, semi-opaque over dark,
but this is called “scumbling.” It is,
however, in fact, if done with a free
hot<a id='t178'></a> dry brush, a glaze, and he may
have thus toned his pictures. That
tone once removed, as in the case of
the Sheba, we believe irrecoverable
but by such a master-hand as put it
on, and possessed of the same pure
medium. We fancy we discover in
the working that a great deal of the
detail of his pictures was painted in
this method. To expect that time
only will restore that fine glow is
worthy the philosopher of Laputa,
and his resolution to extract sunbeams
from cucumbers. Poor Claude!
Professors of the art of painting
are far worse off than professors
of literature, whose tormentors are
but the printer’s devil and the compositor.
The poor painter has an
endless generation of tormentors.
The “Quidlibet audendi” is not his
motto; his genius will never be half
so daring as the hands of his scrubbers.
Let him sit at his easel, and, in
his enthusiasm, throw sunshine from
his brush, and dream fondly that it
will be eternal; a host of cleaners
are looking over his shoulder, or lurking
in secret, to catch the treasure,
and smudge his dream and his work
out for ever. And when they have
visibly, too visibly, done their worst,
old Time, that used to be represented
as the “Edax rerum,” the general
destroyer, is introduced as a newly-dubbed
professor of the art of cleaning
and restoring by dirt.</p>

<p class='c010'>We do not, however, wish to speak
disrespectfully of picture-cleaners, or
picture-varnishers, or picture-dealers.
There are many very skilful and very
useful, and, of dealers, honourable and
liberal. Nor do we say this without
knowledge; yet habit creates boldness,
and removes caution. Like the
medical profession, cleanership, it is
to be feared, must kill before it has
learned to cure. But the professors
sometimes forget the wholesome rule,
“Fiat experimentum in corpore vili.”
Even the wise Sir David Brewster
confesses to having dabbled in destruction.
There is not a man of note
in it but must have killed his man;
and few are so happy as the wonderful
Mr Lance, to make a new one so
well that none can tell the difference.
Indeed, Mr Lance’s magic brush did
a great deal more. A cleaner had
wiped out of existence whole members—man
and horse; sometimes had
left half a horse, and scarcely half a
man, and sometimes had ironed them
all out together. Mr Lance brought
all to life again, without having ever
seen one of them; and all so like, that
their most familiar acquaintances had
never missed them, nor known they
had ever been defunct. Yet was his
modesty equal to his skill. He never
boasted of his performance. Man and
horse were revivified, and remounted,
and caracoled with the utmost grace
and precision before himself and the
public, with unbounded applause;
and the wonderful restorer was contented
to sit quietly in a corner, as if
unconscious of his own creations, and
deaf to the loudest blast of Fame’s
trumpet. If we have wearied our
readers with too long discussions upon
technicalities, we can now make
amends by retiring behind the scenes,
first introducing Mr Lance himself,
who will be as amusing to others as
he has been to us. But there is a
prologue to every play; we would
not usher in so celebrated a performer
without one.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every one acquainted with the National
Gallery knows the Velasquez
“Boar-hunt.” It was always a celebrated
picture, and henceforth will be
more celebrated than ever. In the
very Index of the Report it occupies
more than a whole page. The famous
Erymanthian boar never gave half
the sport, though it required a Hercules
to kill him. But there is a difference:
he was killed, and frightened
people after he was dead; this boar
was killed, and brought to life again,
and pleased every one ever after. It
had been hunted in many countries,
and would have been hunted in many
more, had it not received its Apotheosis
from the hand of Sir Robert
Peel, and found a place in the galaxy
of the National Gallery.</p>

<p class='c010'>This picture was presented to Lord
Cowley by the Court of Spain; and
from him came into the hands of Mr
Farrer, a dealer in pictures. By him
it was sent to Holland, having been
refused by our Gallery, and offered to
the king, who rejected it. On its return
from Holland, Mr Farrer left it
in its case, in his front shop, with the
direction on it to his Majesty the King
of Holland—no direction to Mr Farrer
appearing. Mr B. Wall, one of
the Commissioners, sees the case, and
asks what it contains; is told the Velasquez:
has the “impression,” but is
not quite certain, that Mr Farrer told
him it was going to the King of Holland.
Mr B. Wall upon this goes
to Sir Robert Peel, and both fear
the picture may be lost; and, with
the sanction and at the desire of Sir
R. Peel, it was purchased for the Gallery.
Now, Mr B. Wall was not the
only person who saw the case in Mr
Farrer’s shop. Mr Morris Moore was
one, and, as he says, there were many
others. He names two—Mr Coningham
and Mr Chambers Hall—to all
of whom Mr Farrer, according to the
evidence of Mr Morris Moore, told the
same tale—namely, “that the Trustees
were but just in time to save it
from exportation to the King of Holland.”
This Mr Farrer stoutly denies,
and Mr Morris Moore offers to
take his oath to the fact. In the
denial, Mr Farrer states, that he may
have said he was going to send it
<em>abroad</em>, for that he intended to offer
it in Paris; but, after a while, speaks
rather uncertainly, not knowing exactly
where abroad he should have
sent it; but it is possible he may have
intended again to send it to Holland,
under a kind of conviction that the
King of Holland would, after all,
have it. Then he asserts that the
visit from, and conversation with, Mr
Morris Moore upon the subject were
before, not after, the picture had gone
to Holland. Mr Moore, on the other
hand, is positive it was after it had
returned, because it was then secured
for the National Gallery, and Mr Farrer
admits it was not so secured till
after its return from Holland. This
is, as far as we can make it, a plain
statement, in abstract, from the evidence.
The Commissioners leave
these “discrepancies” where they
found them; so do we. It is a common
saying that truth lies somewhere
between two contradictory statements.
Wherever it may appear to lie, there
appears but little space, on any intermediate
ground, upon which it could,
by any possibility, stand upright. This
little history has seen the picture lodged
in the Gallery. We must beg the
reader to imagine it not as yet to have
been located, that he may learn a little
of its antecedents. Lord Cowley had
placed the picture in the hands of Mr
Thane to keep, where it remained
some years. But Mr Lance shall tell
the tale. “After a considerable time,
Mr Thane, as I heard afterwards, had
been commissioned to clean the picture,
and reline it. A colourman was
employed to reline the picture, a most
skilful man, and, in relining it, I understand,
he blistered it with hot
irons.... When the picture was returned
to Mr Thane in this condition,
it naturally distressed him very much;
he was a very conscientious man, and
he became very deeply distressed
about it: he saw the picture passing
over his bed in procession. After a
certain time, he thought it got worse,
and that the figure of it was more
attenuated; and at length he fancied
he saw a skeleton. In fact, the poor
man’s mind was very much injured.
It was then proposed that he should
employ some painter to restore the
picture; and three persons were selected
for that purpose. Sir David
Wilkie, Sir Edwin Landseer, and myself,
were mentioned; but it was supposed
that neither Sir David Wilkie
nor Sir Edwin Landseer would give
their time to it, and that probably I
might; and, therefore, the picture was
placed with me, with a representation
that, if I did not do something to it,
serious consequences would follow to
the cleaner. I undertook it, though
I was very much employed at the
time; and, to be as short as possible,
I painted on this picture. I generally
paint very rapidly, and I painted on
that occasion as industriously as I
could, and was engaged for six weeks
upon it. When it was completed,
Lord Cowley saw it, never having
been aware of the misfortune that had
happened to the picture. It was then
in Mr Thane’s possession, and remained
with him some time afterwards.
From that time I saw no more of the
picture until it was exhibited in the
British Gallery some time afterwards,
where it was a very popular picture,
and was very much thought of. Since
then, I have heard it was sold to the
nation; and twice I have seen it in
the National Gallery. I saw it only
about a week ago, and I then thought
it was not in the same condition (indeed,
I am certain it is not) as when
it was exhibited in the British Gallery
formerly, after I had done it.”
This is sufficient evidence that the
picture has been damaged in cleaning.
Let us pursue the story through question
and answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Q.</em> 5124. What was the state of
the picture when it came into your
hands? There were portions of the
picture entirely gone.—<em>Q.</em> 5125. What
portions? Whole groups of figures,
and there was a portion of the foreground
entirely gone also.—<em>Q.</em> 5126.
Do you mean that celebrated group
which is so often copied—the man in
a red coat? That is original. I think
that any man, with any knowledge
of art, will see at once that that is
original; and I am only surprised
that it has not been seen that other
parts are original also.—<em>Q.</em> 5127.
Which portions of these groups did
you chiefly restore? You are very
near the mark when you speak of the
red coat; it is the group on the right
hand; the outlines were entirely gone.—<em>Q.</em>
5128. Do you mean to say, that
the whole of the paint was removed
from that part of the picture? Entirely.—<em>Q.</em>
5129. Was the canvass laid
bare? Entirely.—<em>Q.</em> 5130. What
guide had you in repainting those
groups? Not any.—<em>Q.</em> 5131. Did you
paint groups that you yourself imagined
and designed? Yes.—<em>Q.</em> 5132.
Did Lord Cowley not distinguish any
difference in the groups? Not any.—<em>Q.</em>
5133. What was the extent of
paint wanting on that group which
you say you repainted on the right—was
it a portion as large as a sheet of
note-paper? Larger, considerably;
the figures themselves are larger than
that.—<em>Q.</em> 5134. Was it as large as a
sheet of foolscap? About that size, I
should imagine.—<em>Q.</em> 5135. There was
a piece of the original paint wanting
as large as that? Yes, in the foreground.—<em>Q.</em>
5136. It was totally
wanting, and the canvass to that extent
laid bare—is that so? Yes.—<em>Q.</em>
5137. And on that bare canvass
you painted the groups of figures we
see now? Exactly.—<em>Q.</em> 5138. Will
you have the goodness to describe to
the committee any other portions of
the picture where the paint was in a
similar or in an analogous state? The
whole of the centre of the picture was
destroyed, with slight indications here
and there of men; there were some
men without horses, and some horses
without men.—<em>Q.</em> 5139. That is in
the arena? Yes.—<em>Q.</em> 5140. You are
speaking of the figures on horseback?
Yes: some riders had no horses, and
some horses had no riders.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We must curtail the evidence for
want of space. It appears that his
brush, taking the number of square
feet, went over a great deal more than
half. He is sorry to say it is now
gone back to “Velasquez mutilated.”
But are there not infallible judges to
discover all this repainting? “I may
mention that, many years ago, when
the picture was at the British Gallery,
I was invited by a member of the
Academy to go and look at it; and I
went there; Mr Seguier and Mr Barnard
(who was also a picture-cleaner)
were present. They said, ‘I know
what you have come for; you have
come to see the magnificent Velasquez.’
I said, ‘Well, I have;’ and,
with the greatest simplicity in the
world, I said it gave me a notion
that some part had been much repaired
and painted upon: upon which Mr
Barnard, the keeper of the British
Institution, said immediately, ‘No,
you are wrong there; we never had
a picture so free from repair in our
lives.’ I did not think it at all desirable
to make any statement,” &#38;c.
He hopes there is no engraving of the
picture, for the group in the foreground,
entirely his, would be detected
immediately.</p>

<p class='c010'>So much for Mr Lance’s doings with
this celebrated Boar-hunt, which,
whatever part of it may be by Mr
Lance, we are very glad to see in our
National Gallery, and should have
been more glad if they had abstained
from cleaning it. But Mr Lance has
further amusement for us. That account
is the serious play in which he
was principal actor. We shall see
him again in the entertainment. It
has a very excellent title—“Diogenes
in search of an Honest Man.” The
part of Diogenes, Mr Lance; the
point being, the vain search for a time,
but discovered at last—in whom? In
a negro. This was Mr Diogenes
Lance’s satirical discovery. There
are countries where the scene must
not be exhibited. He shall tell the
story. “<em>Q.</em> 5230. Have you ever
restored any other picture in the ordinary
course of your professional practice?
During the time I was engaged
upon that picture at Mr Thane’s, he
had a picture belonging to the Archbishop
of York, to which rather an
amusing thing occurred.—<em>Q.</em> 5231.
What was the subject of it? It was
a picture of Diogenes in search of an
Honest Man, by Rembrandt; a portion
of it was much injured. Mr
Thane said to me, ‘I wish you would
help me out in this difficulty.’ He did
not paint himself.—<em>Q.</em> 5232. Which
Archbishop was it? The Archbishop
of York. I said, ‘What am I to do?
tell me what you want.’ He said,
‘There’s a deficiency here—what is
it?’ I said, ‘It appears to me very
much as if a cow’s head had been
there.’ He said, ‘It cannot be a
cow’s head; for how could a cow stand
there?’ I said, ‘That is very true;
there is no room for her legs.’ I fancied
first one thing, then another: at
one time, I fancied it was a tree that
was wanting; and at length I said,
‘Well, I will tell you what will do—if
you will let me put in a black man
grinning, that will do very well, and
rather help out the subject.’ He said,
‘Could you put in a black man?’ I
said, ‘Yes, in a very short time;’
and in about half an hour I painted
in a black man’s head, which was
said very much to have improved the
picture. Shortly afterwards Mr Harcourt
came in, and seeing the picture,
he said, ‘Dear me, Mr Thane, how
beautifully they have got out this picture!
my father will be delighted.
We never saw this black man before.’
And that is the extent of my picture-repairing.”
Mr Lance is a man of
humour. When Mr Harcourt came
to examine the picture, did what his
namesake Launce in the play said
occur to the painter? This is “the
blackest news that ever thou heard’st.”
But no; both Lances were discreet in
their humour, and the one thought
like the other—“Thou shalt never
get a secret from me but by a parable.”
The idea of a black man grinning at
the folly of Diogenes, in looking for
an honest man among the whites, was
a most original piece of humour, worthy
the concentrated geniuses of all
the Launces that ever were.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the world knew Mr Lance’s
powers as a painter of still life; he
has now doubly established his fame,
and notwithstanding that his modesty
would look shy upon his performances
on the Velasquez “The Boar-hunt,”
as nobody else has been startled by
them, we sincerely hope they will be
allowed to remain—that is, as much
of them as the cleaners have spared.
We hope, also, that no experimentalists
in nostrums will be allowed to
reiterate the attempt of the fable, and
try to “wash his blackamore white.”
Let this be the picture’s motto—“Hic
niger est, hunc tu——caveto.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is to be feared that picture-cleaning
has become a necessary evil, as
patients who have been long under
the hands of empirics must needs
have recourse to regular practitioners
to preserve even a sickly life. Empirical
nostrums must be got out of the
constitution, for by a habit of maintenance,
however advantageous they
may appear at first, they are sure to
side with the disease, and kill the
patient. There is the first Mr Seguier’s
boiled oil, that terrible black
dose—must that be allowed to remain?
Then comes the question, by
what desperate remedies is it to be
eradicated? There is the Gaspar
Poussin landscape near the injured
Claude “Queen of Sheba,” the “Abraham
and Isaac:” we remember it a
very beautiful clear picture. It is
now all obscured; there are large
brown patches in the once lucid sky.
As so large a proportion of the pictures
in the Gallery are suffering under
this oil-disease, and seem to petition
for a ticket to the hospital, we offer a
suggestion made by De Burtin, that
experienced and cautious cleaner, who
speaks with utter abhorrence of the
oiling system. He says that he tried
every secret of his art without success;
“continuing always my experiments,
however, though with little hope, I
have at length had the happiness to
find in the application of this same
oil itself the means of so softening the
old oil, that I have afterwards, with
spirit of wine, removed both the oils,
new and old together, without at all
injuring the picture. Although this
plan has succeeded equally well with
four pictures on which I had occasion
to employ it, yet I must not be understood
to hold it out as infallible until,
from the number of the cases in which
it is tried, and the uniformity of its
success, it shall earn for itself that
title; but, persuaded that the want of
other known means will induce connoisseurs
to make trial of this one, I
feel desirous to put them in possession
of all the information that I myself
have in regard to it. My four pictures,
all painted on panel, were evidently
covered with an oil which gave
them an aspect alike sad and monotonous,
and which seemed to be of many
years’ duration. I gave them a coat
of linseed oil during the warmest days
of summer, renewing once, and even
twice a-day, the places on which it
seemed to be absorbed. On the
twelfth day the oil on one of the pictures
was become so softened that it
clung to my finger. I then employed
good spirit of wine, without any other
admixture whatever, to remove all the
oil which I had put upon the picture;
and the pleasure I experienced was
only equalled by my surprise, when I
saw the vivacity of the colours restored
under my hands as the spirit of
wine removed the old oil along with
the new. After a few days’ interval,
the other three pictures gave me renewed
occasion for congratulation by
the same results, and with equal
success.”</p>

<p class='c010'>De Burtin has at least the great
merit of having no concealments in
his practice. And here the Commissioners
have done well in recommending
that no varnishes be used, the
ingredients of which are kept secret.
Mr Farrer thinks he is the only person
in this country using gum damas.
He is mistaken—we have used it many
years, and agree with him that it is
far less liable to chill than mastic.
The recommendation, also, that, before
cleaning a picture, an able chemist
should be applied to, is a proper precaution,
which would, of course, include
varnishing. That pictures may
not be subject to secret varnishes,
the only one we would have kept
secret is that mentioned by Mr
Niewenhuys, the experimentalising in
which brought the indignation of the
court of Lilliput on the unfortunate
Gulliver. Picture-scourers have been
hitherto a ruthless race—with their
corrosives they take the life’s blood
out of the flesh of works, like true
Vampires, and appropriately enough
talk of <em>vamping</em> them up. Few are
as conscientious as Mr Thane, to be
persecuted with the “processions” of
the skeletons they make. There is an
amusing story illustrated by Cruikshank.
A lover, anxious for the safety
of his sick mistress, goes about seeking
physicians; he is gifted, for the
occasion, to see over the doors of the
faculty the ghosts of the patients they
had killed. It is within doors we
would have the picture possessor go.
The outer shop of the cleaner is enchanting—perhaps
it may exhibit a
face half of which is cleaned, and half
dirty, that, according to Mr Ford’s
notion of looking better and worse,
customers may take their choice of the
dingy or the clean. The connoisseur
and collector need have some “Diable
Boiteux” to take them unseen into
the interior laboratories where the
ghosts and skeletons lie concealed,
while the Medea’s pot is on the fire,
whose boiling is to transfer new flesh
to the dry bones, that they may be
produceable again, as they often are,
novelties of a frightful vigour and unnatural
sprightliness, to be reduced
to an after-sobriety under a regimen
of boiled oil and asphaltum. Even Mr
Lance’s work, which was believed to
be original, has been obscured and
otherwise damaged. Salvator Rosa’s
“Mercury and the Woodman,” is as if
it had been dipped in “the sooty
Acheron.” There is little pleasure in
looking at pictures in such a state.
Altogether, then, to leave pictures
“black, dirty, and in a filthy state,”
a condition which Mr Stansfield<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c008'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
properly abominates, is to mislead the
public, whom to instruct is one great
object of a National Gallery. But
who is to restore the gem-like lustre
when once removed? There should
be a cleaning, or rather a preservation
committee. Philosophers say, that
diamonds are but charcoal; none have,
however, succeeded in converting the
carbon into diamonds; but it may be
possible to convert the diamonds of
art into charcoal, or into something
worse, “black, dingy, and filthy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>We scarcely know where to stop
with so large a volume as this Report,
with its evidence before us. The
questions, with their answers, amount
to the astonishing number of 10,410!
We necessarily leave much matter
untouched, very much interesting
matter—We would gladly enlarge
upon some of the suggestions thrown
out in our article on this subject of
December, but adequate space in this
Magazine may not be allowed. Yet
we will refer to one suggestion, because
it is now the very time that
public attention should be directed to
it; we mean the appointment of Professorships
of the Fine Arts at our
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
Lord Palmerston’s letter to
the Chancellor of Cambridge shows
that great changes are in contemplation.
Such professorships would be a
graceful offering to the universities,
who may have been a little suspicious
of the movement of a commission; and
we feel sure, that nothing could be
more promotive of the fine arts, the
real taste of the country, or more
beneficial, as leading the educated to
pursuits of a high and noble nature.
We will not attempt to discuss the
“Removal of the Gallery.” The Blue
Book affords details, and plans of
site. The appendix is full of valuable
information; but it contains matter
upon which we feel some alarm. We
know there is a scheme, under peculiar
favour, to make our National Gallery
a Chronological Almanac of Art, than
which nothing can be more worthless
or more beyond the objects for which
we should have a National Gallery at
all. What we should collect is a large
subject, which we may feel disposed
to consider more at large in a future
article.</p>

<p class='c010'>The public will now inquire, what
is to be the result of this pains-taking
Commission? We are aware that
the Chairman repudiates the Report.
It is one to which he does not give
his assent. We know not the particulars
in which he differs from the
Report as agreed upon. We could
have wished, for the sake of the arts,
that there had been no difference.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of this there can be no doubt, that
the system, if such it may be called,
is most unsatisfactory. If we would
have a National Gallery at all, the
public have a right to demand that it
shall be one befitting the dignity of
the country and the objects proposed
by such an establishment,
none of which, it is manifest from the
entire evidence, can be realised unless
the trust be thoroughly revised.
Evils to be avoided are now laid bare
to sight. If it be true,</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>A GLANCE AT TURKISH HISTORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Had history recorded the increase
and decrease in the numbers of mankind
with the attention it has bestowed
in chronicling the names of
the worthless dynasties which have
devoured the wealth of nations, and
annihilated the accumulations of national
industry, the history of the
Turks would occupy a prominent
place in the annals of the human
race. No other people has made
such extensive conquests. They
subdued China before the Moguls,
and they formed a considerable part
of the armies of Genghis Khan and
Tamerlane, which subdued Russia
and ravaged Syria. Even at the
present day, though fallen from their
ancient power, they are spread over
a considerable portion of Europe and
Asia, from the Adriatic and the Danube
to the lake Baikal and the
sources of the Lena. Their original
seats are supposed to lie round the
Altaï mountains. The Turkish nations
of the present day, besides the
descendants of the Seljouks, the Turkomans,
and the Othomans, who dwell
in the sultan’s dominions, are the
Usbeks, the Ugours, the Kirgises, the
Baskirs, the tribe called Nogay Tartars,
and the so-called Tartars of
Astrakan and Kasan. The real Tartars,
or Moguls, are a different people,
and the Kalmuks on the Volga
are of Tartar, not Turkish race.</p>

<p class='c010'>The only modern European nations
which pretend to be mentioned in
Scripture, are the Turks and Russians.
Historical antiquaries tell us
that Togarmah is used for Turk; and
they affirm, that the Targhitaos of
Herodotus, whom the Scythians called
the founder of their nation, and the
son of Jupiter, is identical with the
Togarmah of Moses and Ezekiel.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c008'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The Russians can boast of much
more precise notice in Scripture than
their enemies the Turks. Though
their name is omitted in our translation,
it occurs in the Septuagint three
times, and under the peculiar ethnic
denomination in which it reappears in
the Byzantine historians. The word
is Ῥὼς, and on this name Gibbon remarks,
“Among the Greeks this national
appellation has a singular form
as an undeclinable word;” but he
does not mention that it is found in
the Septuagint. The second and
third verses of the thirty-eighth chapter
of Ezekiel, according to the Greek
text, read thus: “Son of man, set
thy face against Gog, the land of Magog,
the chief prince of the Russians
(ἄρχοντα Ῥὼς), Meshech and Tubal,
and prophesy against him, and say,
Thus saith the Lord God, I am against
thee, O chief prince of the Russians,
Meshech and Tubal.” And again, in
the first verse of the thirty-ninth
chapter: “Therefore, son of man,
prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus
saith the Lord God, Behold, I am
against thee, O Gog, the chief prince
of the Russians, Meshech and Tubal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Russians are said also to be
noticed in the Koran, though not with
the same distinctness, under the name
of Al Rass. In the chapter Al Forkan,
which is the twenty-fifth of Sale’s
translation, it is said, “We have prepared
for the unjust a painful torment.
Remember Ad and Tamud, and those
who dwelt at Al Rass.” In the chapter
called the letter Kaf, which is the
fiftieth of Sale’s translation, we also
find: “The people of Noah, and those
who dwelt at Al Rass, and Thamud,
and Ad, and Pharaoh, accused the
prophets of injustice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The earliest authorities, however,
who furnish us with an account of
the Turkish nation as it now exists,
with the distinct nationality and language
preserved to the present day,
are the Byzantine historians, Menander
and Theophylactus Simocalta.
The latter historian gives a very
interesting account of the condition
of the Turks in the sixth century of
our era. They were then the sovereigns
of a great city called Tavgas;
they were the most valiant and populous
of nations; they lived under the
protection of just laws, and carried on
an extensive commerce. Tavgas is
supposed to be the name of a Chinese
city, which was then one of the seats
of the Turkish government, for there
is no doubt that somewhat before this
period the Turks had conquered a considerable
part of the north of China.
Indeed, traces of the language of these
early conquerors are still preserved,
which are identical with the Turkish
spoken to-day at Constantinople, for
time has effected less change in the
Turkish than in any other European
language. Collateral evidence concerning
the power of the Turks in
central Asia during the latter part of
the fifth, and early part of the sixth
centuries, is afforded by the history of
the life and travels of Hiouen-thsang,
recently translated by Monsieur Julien,
whether that work be really the composition
of a Chinese contemporary,
or only a Chinese compilation from
earlier Arabic authorities.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c008'><sup>[8]</sup></a> It is certain
that about the commencement of
the sixth century the Turks ruled all
central Asia, as far south as the Hindookoosh,
including the ancient Sogdiana
and Bactria.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first political intercourse between
the Turks and a European
state occurred towards the middle of
the sixth century. The great khan of
the Turks sent an embassy to Justinian
I., to persuade the Roman empire
to refuse an asylum to the Avars.
The dominions then ruled by the great
khan formed the first of the three
great Turkish empires which have exercised
an important influence on the
social condition of the Christian nations,
both in Europe and Asia. The
second of these empires was that of
the Seljouk Turks, which caused the
crusades, and ruined the Byzantine
empire. And the third was that of
the Othoman Turks, which destroyed
the Greek empire, and has long been
the master, patron, or tyrant, of the
patriarchs of Constantinople, Jerusalem,
Antioch, and Alexandria.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first Turkish empire took its
rise from the oppression of the Avars,
who were the dominant people in
Asia, and who are supposed to have
been a mixed race of Mogul and
Turkish origin. The oppression of
the Avars was submitted to as long
as the body of the Turkish people
was confined by its circumstances to
an agricultural and pastoral life. The
population being dispersed in small
communities, which lived without
much intercommunication, was composed
of as many isolated tribes as
there are springs in the plains they
inhabitated; and these tribes were
as incapable of acquiring common
motives of action as the population
of the islands in the eastern seas.
But the scene changed in the fifth
century. The Turks who dwelt on
Mount Altaï grew rich by mining
operations and manufactures. They
became the principal traders in iron
and steel, and the manufacturers and
merchants of the arms and armour
required in the Avar empire. But
the government soon endeavoured to
appropriate the wealth which it saw
was created by the industry of its
subjects to administrative purposes.
Taxation was increased, and monopolies
were established, to enable the
court of the Avar emperor to display
the power of centralisation. Governmental
pageantry, court spectacles,
and military pomp, consumed
the wealth of the people in the unknown
capital of this vanished empire;
while the Turkish people, now inspired
by common feelings, called for
an administration that would dig
wells, and construct cisterns and caravanserais
in the desert. The Turks
were now united by the lessons which
their trade had disseminated through
every province. With improved intercourse
they had gained a more
enlarged experience, and acquired
national feelings. They at last rose
in rebellion; and before the middle
of the sixth century, the first great
Turkish empire was founded by Toumen
the blacksmith, the ancestor of
Genghis Khan, and Timor the lame.
This empire extended from the Caspian
sea to the ocean. The great
Khan of the Turks, Askel, who sent
an embassy to the Roman emperor
Justinian I., is supposed to have
been the son of Toumen.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the year 568 another embassy
arrived at Constantinople from the
great Khan Dizaboulos, with a letter
for Justin II., written in the Scythian
character, which, whatever it was,
was not unknown to the learned interpreters
of the Roman foreign office.
One great object of Turkish diplomacy
had been to get possession of
the whole of the silk trade with
Europe, but the Turkish ambassadors
had been astonished to find that Justinian
had already succeeded in introducing
the culture of the silk-worm
in the Roman empire, and that the
imperial court was rich in native silk,
manufactured in Asia Minor and the
islands. The ambassadors of Dizaboulos,
however, concluded the first
formal treaty between the Turks and
the emperors of Constantinople; the
bond of union between the courts of
Mount Altaï and Byzantium was
hostility to Persia, and very profound
and enlightened views concerning
the maintenance of the balance of
power in the East, while the tie which
then connected the interests of the
Turks with those of the Romans and
Greeks was commerce.</p>

<p class='c010'>The long wars between the Persian
and Roman empires, and the arbitrary
measures of the Persians, had
stopped all commercial communications
between India and Europe
through the Persian dominions. The
countries on the shores of the Mediterranean
had in consequence been
compelled to draw their supplies of
Indian and Chinese produce, and the
productions of the Spice islands, of
which there was then an immense
consumption, by way of the Red Sea.
This trade, even as early as the time
of Pliny, was so extensive as to excite
the wonder of that aristocratic
Roman. In the sixth century it
had greatly increased, and both Arabia
and Ethiopia were in a most prosperous
condition, from the great profits
it poured into those countries.
In the year 523 the king of Ethiopia
was able to collect a fleet of thirteen
hundred ships in the Red Sea, and to
obtain abundant supplies for a large
army on the coast of Arabia, where a
single ship and a company of infantry
would find it difficult to procure
provisions for a week. After the reign
of Justinian this commerce rapidly declined.
The increase of piracy on the
coast near the entrance of the Persian
gulf, and the wars of the Ethiopian
kings in Arabia, were simultaneous
with the poverty, depopulation, and
destruction of capital in Africa and
Italy, caused by the Vandal and
Gothic wars of Justinian. At this
crisis, when Alexandria and Rome
were rapidly declining, the security
which the extent of the Turkish empire
and the policy of the great Khan
afforded to merchants, turned a great
portion of the Eastern trade towards
Constantinople. The Indian traders
began to prefer the caravan journey
through the deserts of central Asia,
to the tedious and dangerous navigation
of the Red Sea. By sea they
could no longer venture to visit the
intermediate ports from fear of pirates,
while on the land journey they could
carry on a profitable trade in slaves,
and in exchanging the precious metals,
at many stations on their way. The
great importance of the slave trade
at this time in central Asia is proved
by the circumstance that the emperor
Tiberius II., <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 578–582, formed a
corps of fifteen thousand mamlouks,
composed entirely of purchased slaves,
imported into the Roman empire by
the traders engaged in the Indian or
the fur trade. Had the supply continued,
and had the successors of
Tiberius II. pursued the same policy,
the Roman empire would in all probability
have been overthrown by
Turkish mamlouks, as that of the
caliphs of Bagdat was by following a
similar military system at a later
period.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first Turkish empire was not
of long duration. The Khazar kingdom,
whose relations with the Roman
and Persian empires in the hour of
their decline give it an important
place in history, arose in its western
fragments, and inherited a considerable
portion of its power and commercial
influence. But the Khazars,
though called Turks by the Byzantine
historians, Nicephorus the patriarch
and Theophanes, are supposed
by modern scholars to have been a
people of mixed race.</p>

<p class='c010'>There are several points connected
with the history of the rise
and fall of the first Turkish empire
which are interesting, as marking an
era in the progress of civilisation.
At no previous period in the history
of mankind were greater changes
made in the commercial, political,
and religious ideas of mankind. Religion
was then closely connected
with political organisation. Christianity
was identified with the Roman
government; the religion of Zoroaster
with Persian domination. The fact
that both Christianity and the religion
of Zoroaster were declining in
the sixth century is unquestionable.
Historians have not clearly explained
the causes of a revolution so degrading
to human nature. In Arabia, in
central Asia, and in Spain, an extensive
conversion to Judaism heralded
the extraordinary rapidity with
which the lizard-eaters of Arabia, led
by the followers of Mahomet, exterminated
the religion of Zoroaster,
and converted the majority of the inhabitants
of Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia,
Egypt, and Africa to Mohammedanism.
It is evident that
an internal canker in the social condition
of the Christians in the Roman
empire, and of the inhabitants of
Persia, prepared the way for the
desolation of many of the richest provinces
of the ancient world.</p>

<p class='c010'>The second Turkish empire was
founded by the Seljouks in the eleventh
century. Its power grew up
on the political decline of the caliphate
of Bagdat and of the Byzantine empire.
The dominions of the caliphs
had been dismembered, and Bagdat
itself had been plundered by Turkish
mamlouks, before it was conquered
by Togrulbeg with his Seljouks. The
Byzantine empire, which, by the creation
of a systematic and legal administration,
had reinvigorated the expiring
energies of the eastern Roman
empire, had declined into a pure despotism,
and the rulers of Constantinople
were rapidly devouring the
wealth and diminishing the numbers
of their subjects by financial oppression.
The exploits of Togrulbeg,
Alp Arslan, and Malek Shah, may be
read in the pages of Gibbon, which
have secured them fame wherever
English literature is known. Many
traces of their handiwork are visible
at the present,—monuments of what
is called their glory. When they entered
the countries between the Persian
Gulf, the Caspian, the Black Sea,
and the Mediterranean, they found
them filled with cities, which, though
declined in splendour and wealth by
the loss of their municipal administrations,
in consequence of the rapacious
centralisation of the Roman, Byzantine,
and Mohammedan empires, were
nevertheless still well inhabited, and
surrounded by a numerous agricultural
population. But with the coming of
the Seljouks, “the verdure fled the
bloody sod.” They were a nomade
people, and their armies were composed
of nomadic tribes, who drew
their supplies from the flocks and
herds which moved with them. The
inhabitants of cities were their enemies
unless they became their tributaries;
and in order to preserve a
garrison in the countries they conquered,
it was necessary for them to
exterminate the cultivators of the soil
in the richest and most central plains
of their dominions. An encampment
of tents could only be secure from
surprise by being surrounded to the
extent of a day’s journey by untilled
pastures. Similar desolation has been
effected in agricultural countries for
ignobler objects. In England the
traveller may still see the effects
of an arbitrary act of devastation,
perpetrated about the same period,
by William the Conquerer, in the New
Forest; and in wandering through
Asia Minor many of our readers have
probably passed over districts as fertile
as the plains of Poland and Moldavia,
on which wheat never grows,
but which the page of history informs
us were inhabited by an industrious
agricultural population, until the
towns were destroyed, and the population
exterminated, by Kutulmish
the lieutenant of Alp Arslan, and
Suleiman his son, the lieutenant of
Malek Shah.  The Seljouk empire
was soon divided into the three
secondary kingdoms of Roum or Iconium,
of Syria, and of Persia. It
was subdued and rent into fragments
by the successors of Genghis Khan,
and in the fourteenth century the
Othoman empire arose amidst its dismembered
provinces.</p>

<p class='c010'>Othman, the eponymous hero of the
Othoman empire, entered the Seljouk
empire of Roum with his father, who
was the chieftain of a small tribe consisting
of four hundred families. In
the year 1289 he was appointed governor
of the town of Karady-hissar
by Aladdin III., the last Seljouk
Sultan of Iconium. The market held
on Friday at Karady-hissar was a
trading mart of great local importance.
A judge <a id='t188'></a>sat in the centre of
the people to decide every question
that arose without delay, and without
appeal. Othman frequently occupied
the judicial seat. It happened that,
as he was presiding, an important
dispute was brought before him for
decision, in which a Christian of Belokoma
in the Greek empire complained
of the injustice of a Seljouk noble of
Kermian. Othman decided in favour
of the Christian, and the equity of the
sentence extended his fame, and gave
additional importance to his government.
Years rolled on. Many emirs
established themselves as independent
princes, and have given their names
to several provinces in Asia. Sultan
Aladdin III. died in the year 1307,
and Othman secured to himself a
position as independent as any of the
Seljouk emirs. Just before his death,
he conquered Brusa from the Greeks,
and laid the foundation-stone of the
Othoman empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>This new Turkish empire is remarkable
for its rapid progress and firm
consolidation, but still more so for
the singular fact that it never reposed
on a national basis. The four hundred
families who accompanied Othman’s
father into the Seljouk empire
never became the nucleus even of an
Othoman tribe. The Othoman empire
threatened Europe with conquest;
the Othoman armies were long invincible;
the Othoman administration
was superior to every contemporary
government on the European continent;
but, during the period of
Othoman greatness and power, there
was no such thing as an Othoman
nation. Of the forty-eight grand-viziers
who conducted the administration
from the taking of Constantinople
to the death of Sultan Achmet
I. in 1617, only three or four were of
Othoman or Seljouk families, while
more than thirty were either renegades
or children of Christian parents
brought up in the Mohammedan religion.
The other born Mussulmans
were not even of Turkish race. Few
absolute monarchies have preserved
their pristine vigour with the same unimpaired
energy as the Othoman, and
none have passed triumphantly through
greater disasters. Few national governments,
indeed, could have survived
the fearful ordeal of the defeat at
Angora, and the conquest of Asia
Minor by Timor. Neither Timor nor
any of his contemporaries supposed
that it was possible to re-constitute
the Othoman government; and, indeed,
the ease with which it regained
its power over the Greek Christians
and the Seljouk emirs, is a singular
political phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c010'>This vitality was due to the institutions
implanted in the government
as the very breath of its life, by
Orkhan the son of Othman, the
greatest legislator of modern times.
As a lawgiver, Orkhan was something
between a Lycurgus and a Loyola.
At all events, he puts the modern
constitution-makers of Europe to
shame. They strive to improve the
rotten fabric of their political institutions
by patching the old despotic
garment of Roman law with the new
cloth of representative institutions,
forgetting that the rabid appetite of
centralisation swallows the old garment
and the new patches far more
easily than the boa-constrictor can
swallow a blanket. The institutions
of Orkhan were superior to the Code
Napoleon and its progeny, in as far as
they were framed on the exigencies of
the time, and modelled on the demands
of a progressive state of society—not
borrowed from an extinct people in
a different social and political condition.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have no space to enumerate
Orkhan’s institutions. It is sufficient
for our purpose to notice the keystone
of the fabric which raised a small
band of emigrants from Mesopotamia,
before three generations had elapsed,
into the founders of one of the great
empires of the earth. A tribute of
Christian children, imposed by Orkhan
on the people he conquered, was the
basis, the cement, and the keystone
of the Othoman empire. Never before
were the laws of humanity and the
principles of justice so systematically
violated for so long a period with
such success. The Othoman empire
really dates from the year 1329, for
it was in that year that Orkhan assumed
the power of coining money,
placed his name in the public prayers,
and promulgated his laws. From
that time he was regarded as the
founder and the legislator of a new
state, and not as the ruler of a
Seljouk emirat. Orkhan made his
household the nucleus of his empire.
The strength of his dominions was, by
his legislation and policy, concentrated
within his palace walls. Under his
roof was united a college, conducted
with all the order and talent of a
college of Jesuits, and a range of
barrack-rooms, in which a discipline
prevailed as severe as that of Lycurgus.</p>

<p class='c010'>The history of the institution of the
tribute children, and the formation of
the corps of janissaries, is this: The
Mohammedan law authorises—and,
indeed, commands—every Mussulman
to educate unbelieving children who
have fallen into his power as orphans,
in the Mohammedan faith. As the
military usages of the Seljouk empire
gave the Sultan a fifth of all the spoil
taken in war, Orkhan soon became
possessed of a numerous household of
Christian slaves, whom he might have
sold like the other Seljouk emirs, and
hired mercenary troops with the produce,
or filled his palace with concubines
and poets, and devoted himself
to the pursuit of pleasure and fame.
Orkhan sought instruments to gratify
his ambition, and to extend the dominion
of the Koran. His wars as
the ally of the rebel emperor and
hypocritical historian Cantacuzenus,
furnished him with a large supply of
slaves from the Greek empire. The
base ambition and rapacity of the
rival emperors of Constantinople, induced
them to allow Orkhan to insert
a clause in his treaties, authorising
him to transport Christian captives
to Asia through the Greek territory.
But it was difficult, by means of war,
to secure a constant supply of healthy
and intelligent children of the tender
age required for their conversion,
since the Mohammedan law strictly
prohibits the forced conversion of
prisoners who have attained the age
of twelve. Orkhan’s great object,
however, was to obtain a constant
and regular addition to the young
neophytes in his household. Either
from his own impulse, or at the suggestion
of his brother, Aladdin, who
acted as his prime minister, or of his
relation, Kara Khalil, who was his
most intimate counsellor, he at last
resolved to impose a fixed tribute of
children on every Christian district he
conquered. The measure was highly
approved by all pious Mussulmans,
and, strange to say, it met with little
opposition from the Greek Christians.
The empire of Constantinople had
been so long the scene of civil war,
and its provinces were so desolated
by the fiscal oppression of the imperial
administration, that famine prevailed
among the Greek population in Asia
and Europe for several years; and
many parents saw no mode of saving
their children from starvation but by
sending them to the serai of Orkhan.
The tribute of Christian children established
by Orkhan was extended and
systematised by his son, Murad I.,
and formed the keystone of the political
and military power of the Othoman
empire, until the corruption of
the corps of janissaries by the introduction
of other elements. The tribute
of Christian children, however,
continued until the year 1685, when
it was formally abolished.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tribute children were generally
collected between the ages of seven
and nine. They were at first lodged
in the Sultan’s palace, and carefully
instructed in the principles and forms
of the Mohammedan religion under
the ablest teachers, selected by Orkhan,
who studied their dispositions
and mental capacities. They then
entered on a course of elementary
knowledge and gymnastics. As their
mental capacities were developed, and
their physical strength increased, they
were divided into several classes.
Some, destined to become “men of the
pen,” were educated in legal and administrative
knowledge, and from them
the officials in the civil and financial
administration were usually selected.
Many became secretaries of state,
judges and viziers. Another division
was disciplined as “men of the sword,”
and the celebrated corps of janissaries
was at first composed of select individuals
from this body. This college
of conquering missionaries, when
formed by Orkhan, consisted of only
one thousand, but before the end of
his reign it had increased to three
thousand; and when Mohammed II.
took Constantinople, the number had
attained twelve thousand. The tribute
children were also numerous in
the ranks of the cavalry, artillery, and
police soldiers of the empire. Never,
indeed, was so terrible an instrument
of absolute power created so rapidly
and so completely beyond all external
influence as that which Orkhan formed.
The tribute children were all
members of the household of the Othoman
Sultan. They had no ties of
family or country, and felt no responsibility
but what they owed to the
prophet and the Sultan. At the beck
of the Sultan, and with a fetva of the
mufti, they were ready to strike down
the proudest noble of the Seljouks, to
shed the purest blood of the Arabs,
and to trample on all the hereditary
feelings and prejudices of the courts
of the Caliphs. Against the Christian
nations they were animated with the
most fervent zeal; for it was a principal
part of their education to infuse
an enthusiastic wish to extend the
empire of Islam. Thus Orkhan made
Christian parents the most active
agents in destroying the Christian religion.
It is impossible to reflect on
this lamentable occurrence without
feeling that, had the Greek emperors
and the orthodox priests of the period
given their subjects and their parishioners
as good an education as Orkhan
gave his slaves, the attacks of
the Turks might have been triumphantly
repulsed.</p>

<p class='c010'>That the system of education pursued
in the palace of Orkhan must
have derived some of its excellent
qualities from the family system of
Othman’s household, cannot be doubted.
The Othoman tribe was not morally
corrupted, like the society of the
Seljouk Turks; the history of their
empire bears strong testimony to the
fact during several generations. The
Othoman sultans were, during the
early period of the empire, educated
on the same system, and in the same
manner, as the tribute children, and
no state can show such a long succession
of hereditary sovereigns remarkable
for great talent. The Othoman
institutions testify the sagacity
of Orkhan and Murad I. more than
their rapid conquests. Bayezid the
Thunderbolt, though his rash pride
caused the defeat of Angora and the
ruin of the empire for a time, was
liberal and generous to his Christian
subjects, whom he admitted freely to
his society. Mohammed I., who restored
the empire ruined by his father’s
ambition, was a staunch friend
and a kind master, though, in his
hostilities, as old Phrantzes says, he
was as obstinately persevering as a
camel. Murad II. distinguished himself
by his attention to the administration
of justice, and swept away
many of the abuses which, under the
Greek emperors, had exhausted the
fortunes of the Christians. If any of
his pashas or judges oppressed the
Christians in his dominions they were
severely punished. Mohammed II., the
conqueror of Constantinople, united
the activity of youth with the sagacity
of age, both as a warrior and a statesman.
He possessed considerable literary
and scientific knowledge, and had
made great progress in astrology, then
the fashionable science both among
Christians and Mussulmans. He was
fond of reading, and spoke the Turkish,
Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin,
and Sclavonian languages with fluency.
Such is the character of the early sultans
for six generations, as transmitted
to us in the pages of their mortal enemies,
the Byzantine Greeks. Other
authorities tell us that these infidels
were ready to receive suggestions for
the improvement of their army and
their civil administration, and that
they were indefatigably engaged in
submitting new ideas in the civil administration,
and new inventions in
the art of war, to the most rigorous
examination. Activity and intelligence
were stimulated in every branch
of the public service by the example
of the prince. The consequences form
the staple of early Othoman history.
New combinations in war and politics
presented themselves daily to every
Turkish pasha, which called for a
prompt decision; and as it was incumbent
on him to transmit a report
of the reasons which had determined
his conduct to an able and despotic
master, he soon learned prudence in
counsel as well as promptitude in
action. For two centuries we find
nothing vague and indefinite in the
operations of the Othoman sultans,
or of the pashas intrusted with the
command of their armies. The first
modern school of generals and statesmen
was formed in the Othoman
empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>The general causes of the decline of
the Othoman empire are well known.
The janissaries, instead of being tribute
children, were transformed into a <i><span lang="fr">garde
nationale</span></i>, like what we have seen
flourish and disappear at Paris. But
the logical principles of a paternal
monarchy still exist at Constantinople.
The Sultan is connected with his
people, but can have no ties of family.
He ought not to be the son of a free
woman, but the child of a slave, destitute
of every family tie, in order that
no personal attachments and family
sympathies may interfere with the
cares of administration.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the present moment we hear
it asserted on all sides, that the Othoman
administration is making great
progress in restoring energy and intelligence
in the government. Yet
there are some who insist that the
progress is small; that it is an empire
without roads, and a government
without a people; a central administration
which every subject, be he
Christian or Mussulman, detests for
its financial rapacity and systematic
contempt for justice. Inshallah! there
is some truth on both sides, but it is
not exactly our clue to separate the
wheat from the tares, as they resemble
one another so much at Stamboul
as to confound the skill of European
diplomatists. We know to our cost
that there is no road either to Brusa
or Adrianople fit for a French diligence,
and that an abortive attempt
was made to form a road from Trebizond
to Erzeroum.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great feature of the Othoman
empire at the present day is this, that
capital cannot be profitably employed
in the improvement of the soil, and,
strange to say, this peculiar feature
of its social condition is common to
the new-created monarchy of Greece,
and to no other European state. Trade
often flourishes, cities increase in population
and wealth, gardens, vineyards,
and orchards grow up round
the towns from the overflow of commercial
profits, but the canker is in
the heart of the agricultural population;
a yoke of land receives the same
quantity of seed it did a hundred years
ago, and the same number of families
cultivate the same fields. This is the
most favourable view of the case; but
the fact is, that many of the richest
plains of Thrace, Macedonia, and Asia
Minor, are uncultivated, and have only
the wolf and the jackal for their tenants.
In Greece, too, under the scientific
administration of King Otho, and
with a representative government <i><span lang="fr">à la
Française</span></i>, we see the plains of Thebes,
Messenia, and Tripolitza, present the
same agricultural system which they
did under the Othoman government,
and agriculture in general quite as
much neglected and more despised.
Now the line of demarcation between
civilisation and barbarism really consists
in the profitable investment of
capital in the soil. The agricultural
population is the basis of a national
existence, and unless the soil produce
two bushels of wheat from the same
surface where one formerly grew, and
fatten two sheep where one merely
gathered a subsistence, a nation gains
little in strength and wellbeing though
its cities double their population. The
political and social problem, with regard
to the governments of Constantinople
and Athens, which now requires
a solution, is, to determine the causes
that prevent the cultivation of wheat on
the European and Asiatic coasts of the
Archipelago, and in the fertile island of
Cyprus. The provinces between the
Danube and the Don were in a similar
condition when Akerman, Okzakoff,
and Azof, were Turkish pashaliks;
under the Russian government, they
supply France and England with grain.
Now, the grain-growers of Turkey
could furnish half the grain exported
at present from the Black Sea, and
they could obtain much higher prices
for their produce in consequence of
the great saving of freight to consumers.
Even the fertile districts of
Bithynia and Thrace, bordering on
the Sea of Marmora, than which there
are no finer corn-districts in the world,
cannot furnish Constantinople with
a regular supply of wheat; and the
Osmanlees would often suffer famine
in the capital of their empire, unless
they were provisioned from the provinces
taken from them by the <em>Moskof
gaiour</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>For our part, we must say that it
is not unreasonable to entertain some
doubts of the improvement which has
manifested itself in the Othoman administration
proving permanent, until
we see some increase of the agricultural
population. When the citizens
of Stamboul and Athens begin to colonise
the country, it will be time
enough to talk of the regeneration of
the Othoman power. And unless the
population of the kingdom of Otho of
Bavaria, which possess all the advantages
to be derived from universal
suffrage, joined to the inestimable
liberty of walking about the streets
with pistols and Turkish knives stuck
in the belt, begin to abandon its passion
for coffeehouses, and find pleasure
and profit in the cultivation of
the fields, the improvement of the
Greek nation will not be generally
admitted, even though Athens become
a clean, elegant, and flourishing city.
There must be an evident increase in
the amount of the produce of the soil
from a given number of acres, before
those who study the political history
of nations can be persuaded of the
feasibility of the project of restoring a
Greek empire.</p>

of gossip, as the evidence of deficient
education, and the token of unpolished
intercourse. We allude to the story
in question merely because the preface
to Mr Macaulay’s collected
speeches exhibits a curious specimen
of the wrath which may be excited
by another method of conveyance. It
is not the appropriation of his thunder,
but the non-appropriation of it,
which seems to have roused Mr Macaulay
to a point of very vehement
indignation. It appears that a London
publisher, Mr Vizetelly, availing himself
of a licence which the law permits—namely,
that of reprinting speeches
which have been publicly delivered—conceived
that the issue of a collection
of Mr Macaulay’s speeches might possibly
prove a paying speculation. He
reprinted, as we are given to understand,
from “Hansard’s Parliamentary
Debates,” a number of these
orations; but, in his preliminary
advertisement he appears to have
announced that he did so “by special
permission.” That phrase ought not
to have been used; or if used, it
should have been accompanied by a
distinct reference to the party who
granted the permission. Nine out of
ten of the reading public would certainly
conclude, from the terms employed,
that Mr Macaulay, not the
proprietor of Hansard, had authorised
the publication; and, so far, there is
just ground for complaint. It was not
only natural, but proper, and due to
himself, that Mr Macaulay should have
taken steps to disavow any connection
with, or any countenance given to
the enterprise of the enigmatical publication.
But he has not contented
himself with a broad disclaimer.
Stung to the quick by some absurd
blunders which the self-constituted
editor has committed, and which are
specially referred to in the preface, in
terms of vehement indignation, he has
thought it necessary for his own fame
to suspend “a work which is the
business and the pleasure of my life,
in order to prepare these speeches for
publication.” It is no compliment to
Mr Macaulay to say that the public
will not thank him for having done
so. The desire and eagerness, on
the part of the public, to receive a
new instalment of his History, is only
equalled by their repugnance to peruse
speeches upon subjects the interest
of which has long gone by—a repugnance
not lessened by the impression
that, even when new, the speeches
were not of a superlative degree of
merit. We are sorry that because
Vizetelly—whom Mr Macaulay supposes
to be actuated by a desire of
attaining the same distinction which
was formerly enjoyed by Curll—should
have mistaken Pundits for
Pandects, and magnified the city of
Benares into an oriental nation—because
he has made the gifted orator
“give an utterly false history of Lord
Nottingham’s Occasional Conformity
Bill”—or because he has represented
him as saying “that Whitfield held
and taught that the connection between
Church and State was sinful,”
whereas Whitfield never said anything
of the kind, nor was Mr Macaulay
so ignorant as to have averred
that he did,—we say we are sorry that
because Vizetelly did these things,
our brilliant, though tardy historian,
should have considered his reputation
so dangerously imperilled, as to depart
from his legitimate and most interesting
labours, for the purpose of presenting
us with a mediocre and uninspiring
volume of speeches. It is true
that he avers reluctance, nay, even
disinclination to the task. If that
were his real feeling, he need not
have troubled himself much about
the speculations of Vizetelly. During
the last twenty years, many public
speakers—nay, some men who may
be classed as real orators—all of them
far more distinguished than Mr Macaulay,
for power, energy, pathos, wit,
and influence, have gone to their
graves; and yet no attempt has been
made, though the absence of copyright
in speeches might have encouraged
the speculation, to publish their
works in a collected form. If we
want to form an idea of the styles of
the late Earl Grey, or Lord Durham,
or Sir Francis Burdett, we must necessarily
have recourse to the Mirror of
Parliament. The filial piety of their
relatives, great as it was, did not lead
them to the generous error of supposing
that their speeches would hereafter
rank with those of Demosthenes
or Cicero. In our own day no man,
as a popular orator, equalled Daniel
O’Connell; yet where are his collected
speeches?—and be it remembered
that popular oratory is essentially
Demosthenic, and that O’Connell
could produce a greater effect
upon a mixed audience—which is the
test of oratory—than any other man
of our time. Where are Shiel’s
speeches? In Hansard—where, we
hesitate not to say, the speeches of
every man of the slightest eminence
in public life ought to be allowed to
remain, without separate collection,
at least during his own lifetime, and
until his career is accomplished. Indeed,
there are many prudential
reasons, at the present day, against
the collection of senatorial speeches.
No one has proposed to issue those of
the late Sir Robert Peel, although
there can be no doubt that such a
publication would afford some curious
subjects for commentary. It would
serve the same purpose as the ancient
collections of commonplaces—<i><span lang="la">loci communes</span></i>,
<i><span lang="la">loci rerum</span></i>, &#38;c.—from which the
tyro in rhetoric might draw arguments
adapted for immediate use on either
side of a question. In such a collection
all possible <em>pros</em> and <em>contras</em>
would be found, not drily stated, but
set forth with elaborate ingenuity.
One speech would give the Protestant,
and another the Catholic side of the
question—one while we should find
the orator supporting agriculture
against manufactures—another, manufactures
against agriculture; the
zeal and sincerity being in both cases
the same. Then, what a charming
miscellany Sir James Graham has it
in his power to offer to the public!
What deftness—what dexterity—what
amazing complexity of tergiversation
would be exhibited by a collection
of his Parliamentary speeches! We
feel almost inclined to advise Mr
Vizetelly to ransack Hansard for the
Netherby harangues; the more so because
Mr Macaulay, in his own edition,
has taken care to insert nothing calculated
to irritate Sir James. That is not
altogether fair, and it is certainly the
reverse of valorous. Mr Macaulay had
occasion, in his place in Parliament, to
direct vigorous speeches both against
Sir Robert Peel and against Sir James
Graham. He tells us now in his preface
that “it was especially painful to me
to find myself under the necessity of
recalling to my own recollection, and
to the recollection of others, the keen
encounters which took place between
the late Sir Robert Peel and myself;”
and he pays a very handsome compliment
to the memory of the deceased
statesman. That is graceful, amiable,
and, we doubt not, entirely sincere.
Nevertheless he publishes <em>verbatim</em>,
what he said in debate against Sir
Robert Peel, who is no more; whereas
we find no trace of his famous
speech in the letter-opening case,
directed against Sir James Graham,
who is the living colleague of Lord
John Russell. The omission may
be accidental; or Mr Macaulay may
think the speech in question not so
felicitous as to be worth recording.
If the latter, we differ from him. It
was a spirited speech—much more
nettlesome and pungent than threefourths
of those which he has included
in the present volume; and we have
no doubt that Sir James Graham, if
appealed to, will corroborate our opinion.
Be it observed, however, that
we do not by any means maintain
that Mr Macaulay was bound to reprint
his diatribe against Sir James.
We make these remarks for the purpose
of showing how unwise it is for
any man to become the editor of his
own speeches; seeing that he must
either give huge offence to the living,
or let them escape scot-free, whilst he
repeats his strictures on the dead.
After all, we think he would have
acted prudently in submitting to the
“great wrong,” which Mr Vizetelly,
under the tacit sanction of the law,
which in theory is held to countenance
no wrong, has found it his interest to
inflict. We rather fear that he has
been too hasty in intermitting his
historical labours. Had some excessively
imprudent speculator in literature
chosen to risk his capital by
reprinting from Hansard the speeches
of Lord John Russell or of Lord
Aberdeen, we are certain that Mr
Macaulay, if consulted on the subject,
would have advised these eminent
statesmen—even although the ignoramus
of an editor had distorted the
nature of their arguments, and substituted
Pandects for Pundits—to
abstain from putting forth their lucubrations
in a collected form. We
have that confidence in his judgment
and discretion, when called upon to
advise others in matters of a literary
nature, that we cannot doubt such
would have been the tenor of his recommendation.
But, unfortunately,
in regarding matters personal to themselves,
the great majority of mankind
use glasses materially differing in focus
from those which they assume when
investigating the affairs of others;
and it is painful to remark that, on
this occasion, Mr Macaulay has
acted as his own optician. It would
have been much wiser in him to have
allowed Mr Vizetelly to have disposed
of as many copies as the public
would take, without more remonstrance
than a simple disclaimer, than
to have fastened upon the blunders
about Benares, and Whitfield, and
Lord Nottingham’s Bill, as so many
apologies for bringing forward a revised
and collected series of his
speeches.</p>

<p class='c010'>He has done so, however; and we
have now to consider him as a man,
who, by no means verging towards
the end of his career—for we trust he
may long be spared to delight the
public by the elaborate compositions
of a mind naturally highly gifted,
greatly improved by exercise, and
prodigiously stored with information—has
deliberately chosen to set
forth his claims to be ranked in the
scale of orators. Whether Mr Macaulay
may choose to believe that we
are sincere, or not, in the opinion we
are about to express, is, to us, of little
consequence. Politically, of course,
we differ from him in many respects.
We cannot even challenge, what is
generally understood to be the opinion
of his own party, that he is not qualified
to act in the capacity of a leading
statesman, or member of the Cabinet.
We believe his mind to be of that
cast, that it does not readily and aptly
conform itself to present exigencies.
It is too much wedded to the past,
and to mere party traditions and intrigues.
Let a crisis arrive, demanding
immediate and decided action, and
Mr Macaulay will be found puzzling
back to the Revolution Settlement of
1688, or some other event of lesser
consequence about the same date;
and descanting on the conduct of the
leading Whig Lords of that period,
and the way in which they managed
to juggle and forswear themselves;
and from these premises he would
form conclusions applicable to the
present times. The Whig party leaders
are notoriously addicted to tradition,
but Mr Macaulay’s ideas go back a
great deal farther than is convenient
even for their purpose. They, naturally
enough, do not want the aid of history
farther than concerns their immediate
guidance; and they would be glad to
sink altogether the memory of dynastical
questions, and begin with Fox,
who is the proper god of their idolatry.
Mr Macaulay, by resolutely harking
back to forgotten eras, frightfully
embarrassed his colleagues in the
Cabinet, when he ranked as a minister.
It <em>was</em> an excessive bore to be
told what Danby did or would have
done, or what Halifax meditated, or
William of Orange proposed, when
the point at issue was something
referring to our own day, arising out
of entirely novel circumstances, and
having nothing whatever in common
with the policy that actuated statesmen
at a time when rival dynasties
placed in dispute the true succession
to the crown. In reality, however,
it is no disparagement to Mr Macaulay
to say that, from the peculiar turn of
his mind, the nature of his pursuits,
and the intenseness of his literary
habits, he has failed in acquiring even
a moderate reputation as a statesman.
To the public, his withdrawal or exclusion
from office ought to be anything
but matter of regret; since it
is better, both for his own fame and
for the literary reputation of our
country, that he should be employed
in illustrating its annals according to
his own views and conviction, than
if he were participating in the labours
of Molesworth, Wood, and the other
eminent individuals who drone away
their time in the Cabinet. As an
historian, he has already made himself
a name far more enduring than
that of any mere politician, and he
can very well afford to abandon the
honours and responsibilities of office
to inferior men who regard that alone
as the summit of earthly ambition.
And we know, and are pleased to
know, from his own statement and
from the assurance of his friends, that
he feels anything but regret at having
exchanged the harassments of office
for the literary leisure, which he knows
so well and so effectively to employ.
We are only sorry that he has thought
fit, in this very marked and unusual
manner, to invite public discussion of
his claims to be considered as an
orator. As an historian, and historical
writer, he has already received, in
the pages of the Magazine, a warm
and deserved tribute. Without acknowledging
the soundness of all his
views—indeed, while questioning
many, and decidedly objecting to
some, both as regards facts and conclusion—we
have been, and are ready to
bear testimony to his talent, his research,
the vigour of his style, and
the occasional brilliancy of his pictures.
That he is a literary artist of high
rank and position, we have admitted
most cheerfully, and, we know, have
said so cordially. But he now comes
before us in another character. The
historian requests—nay, demands—that
we shall regard him as a public
speaker, and assign him his proper
place in the roll of orators. In doing
so, he certainly departs from his own
familiar walk, challenges comparison,
which it would have been wise to have
avoided—and provokes criticism which
otherwise would not have been exerted.
When men play many parts,
it is inevitable, unless in the case of
such a phœnix as the Admirable
Crichton, that some one part must be
vastly inferior to the others. As an
historian, an essayist, and a vivid
versifier, we are inclined to rank Mr
Macaulay high. We cannot admit
that he is an orator in the strict sense
of the term. As a public speaker, he
has almost invariably failed in realising
the expectations excited by his
literary renown.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must, as we are aware, assign
sufficient reasons for that opinion;
and we shall be met, at the outset,
by the fact, that a speech from Macaulay
is considered as an event. So
it is; and so, too, in the House of
Commons, would be deemed a speech
from Sir Charles Wood, did that parody
of a statesman confine himself to a
single harangue in the year. Mr Macaulay,
we know, will not suspect us of
any intention of comparing him with
the present President of the Board of
Control. We are in no danger of mistaking
Hyperion for a satyr. But the
truth is, that men who have been
thrust, whether by interest or not,
into high official situations, are as
likely, if they practise general reticence,
to be listened to in the House of
Commons, as are men of exalted intellect;
and that an elderly proser, who
speaks only once in each session, has
a better chance of an audience than
the glib and voluble orator who starts
up in every debate. In public life
Mr Macaulay has shown great discretion.
During the last twenty years
he has spoken but seldom, and never
without careful and elaborate preparation;
therefore, when it becomes
known that he is about to address
the House, he is sure to meet with
a large, respectful, and attentive audience.
Nor is this to be wondered at,
on other grounds; for, independently
of his high celebrity, Mr Macaulay’s
speeches are much better worth listening
to than the majority of those
now delivered in the House of Commons.
The language is correct and
well-chosen, the arguments are carefully
arranged, and there is none of
that hesitation, repetition, and digression,
which frequently disfigures the
efforts of those who have less leisure
beforehand to prepare and adjust their
speeches. The curiosity of the audience
is excited by the eminence of
the speaker, and they are well assured
that what he is about to lay before
them will bear the peculiar and unmistakable
impress of his style. And
so it does; but then the genius of Mr
Macaulay is not of the oratorical kind.
He can impart information—that is,
he can summon to the aid of his arguments
whole lists of precedents, some
of them not very applicable, and countless
parallels, or instances which he
alleges to be such. These give, at all
events, an air of profundity to his discourse,
and cannot be called inappropriate
to the mouth of an historian.
But upon a mixed audience they can
produce very little effect, for this reason,
that they are not familiar with
one out of ten of the cases which he
cites, or the incidents to which he
refers; and, consequently, they must
either receive them on trust, or disregard
them altogether. We do not
think, as some of his associates have
alleged, that Mr Macaulay intends to
make a parade of his acquired learning.
We rather incline to hold that,
as is common with men who addict
themselves greatly to any particular
branch of study, he takes it for granted
that the whole world is studying in
the same direction, and is not conscious
that he is throwing an extravagant
quantity of historical pearls—or,
it may be, paste—before his audience.
Such at least is our belief; for we are
not willing to suppose that Mr Macaulay
would condescend to that very
low kind of pedantry, not unusual
among country preachers and schoolmasters,
which seeks to astonish by the
assumption of superior learning. “It
was in this way,” said Mr Macaulay,
in one of his earlier speeches, “that
Charles II. was forced to part with
Oropesa, and that Charles III. was
forced to part with Squillacci.” Very
likely it was; but how many of the
House of Commons had ever heard
of Oropesa or Squillacci? How many
were familiar with the events he referred
to? Probably not one. He
would have produced the same effect
upon their reason and understanding,
have influenced their convictions
quite as powerfully, if he had told
his audience that Mumbo-jumbo and
Arimaspes had been dismissed by
Don John, or Peter of Portugal. Let
us refer to that passage in his speech
on the Dissenters’ Chapels Bill, which
the ignorant Vizetelly mangled. The
speech is evidently a favourite with
Mr Macaulay, and we presume he has
restored it in its integrity. Addressing
himself to the point, that prescription
constitutes a good title to property,
he brings into the compass of
one page such a mass of illustration
from all ages, nations, and institutions,
that we cease to be shocked at
the barbarism of the Vizetellian blunder,
especially when we observe that
the Jurists who framed the Code of
Justinian are referred to in the same
sentence with the Pundits of Benares.
Indeed, we think that Mr Vizetelly is
fairly entitled to stand upon the very
excuse which the legally-inclined Mr
Bartoline Saddletree proponed, when
challenged by Reuben Butler for an
error on the same subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘It’s owre true, Mr Butler,’ answered
Bartoline, with a sigh; ‘if I
had had the luck—or rather, if my
father had had the sense to send me
to Leyden and Utrecht to learn the
Substitutes and Pandex’——</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘You mean the Institutes—Justinian’s
Institutes, Mr Saddletree?’ said
Butler.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Institutes and substitutes are synonymous
words, Mr Butler, and used
indifferently as such in deeds of tailzie,
as you may see in Balfour’s Practiques,
or Dallas of St Martin’s Styles.
<em>I understand these things pretty weel,
I thank God; but I own I should have
studied in Holland.</em>’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Such far-fetched illustrations necessarily
tend to diminish the force of
Mr Macaulay’s speeches, which is the
more unfortunate, because he is peculiarly
addicted to that kind of argument
which the old rhetoricians styled
the παράδειγμα, being that which is
drawn from Example. Even when
he does not pass into ground altogether
unknown to his audience, when
he refers in support of his position to
some passages in British history, he
avoids those which are most familiar,
and selects the remoter and more obscure.
Hence it is that he so often
fails in exciting and maintaining enthusiasm.
No sympathy can be roused
by references to Sir George Savile,
Hugh Peters, or Praise-God-Barebones;
nor is the substitution of a
political essay for a speech the best
means of commanding the admiration
or influencing the will of an audience.
We are inclined to think that Mr Macaulay’s
early oratorical training has
exercised a prejudicial rather than a
salutary influence over his subsequent
style. He was, we believe, a member
of the Union Debating Society at Cambridge,
in which arena questions of
immediate political interest were discussed
quite as keenly as on the floor
of the House of Commons. Without
pronouncing an opinion hostile to the
institution of debating societies, we
may be allowed to remark, that the
too frequent introduction of politics
as the subject of discussion among the
young can hardly receive the approbation
of any thinking man of maturer
years. The arguments employed on
such occasions must be, and are, the
spent weapons of politicians who are
engaged in real warfare; and these are
used by the juvenile enthusiasts without
any examination as to their soundness
or propriety. There is, in truth,
little sense, and no advantage in this
mimic warfare. Young men are thereby
induced, not to reason, but to dogmatise—not
to argue, but to declaim;
and the opposition which they encounter
to their borrowed views only
serves to strengthen them in prejudice.
The leader of a political debating society
is usually an insufferable specimen
of the juvenile prig. He can prate
for the hour on such generalities as
the constitution, the liberty of the subject,
the rights of the people, and so
forth; but, if you bring him to book,
and demand a distinct explanation of
what he has been saying, you will immediately
discover that he is neither
in possession of fixed notions nor of
intelligible ideas. There is a kind of
frothy rhetoric, very much used in debating
societies, which serves to disguise
commonplaces, and helps to
make them appear almost brilliant to
an inexperienced audience; and in
that sort of rhetoric Mr Macaulay early
became an adept. Most men who have
acquired this style in public are compelled
to get rid of it. At the bar it
would not be tolerated; and it is
worthy of remark that the most shining
lights in debating societies usually
pale their ineffectual fires when
brought into the legal profession. In
the senate, where less precision is
required, they succeed better; but
even there it requires an immense
deal of attrition and wear before
they can become expert masters of
debate. Now it seems to us, after a
diligent perusal of his speeches, that
Mr Macaulay has never been able to
emancipate himself from the bondage
of the debating society. He speaks
now, just as he might have spoken more
than thirty years ago; only that his
language is more select, his range of
illustration larger, and his perorations
more artificial, and therefore more
frigid than before. In point of confidence,
we do not believe that he has
either gained or lost. Some men begin
their public career with diffidence
and trembling, and end by becoming remarkably
self-possessed. Others, who
had a fine stock of assurance to begin
with, are so cowed by the buffets they
receive, as actually to have modesty
forced upon them; and we have known
more than one instance of a young
Boanerges who, by dint of constant
punishment, has been brought to see
the error of his ways, and the exaggerated
estimate he had formed of his
own natural powers. Mr Macaulay,
however, belongs to neither category.
He believed himself an oracle as a
boy: he believes himself an oracle as
a man. And, if justified in the one
belief, who shall venture to say that
he is erroneous in the other? Certain
it is that, in 1826, when he
penned his essay on Milton, he displayed
as much power, taste, and
vigour, as are exhibited in the volumes
of his History given to the
public in 1849. He spoke with more
animation, clearness, and effect, on
the subject of the Reform Bill in 1831,
than on any subsequent occasion,
though some of his later speeches may
have been more highly elaborated. He
is, of course, better informed now on
points of history, science, and literature,
than when he emerged from
Cambridge; but we question whether
he has gained much additional knowledge
of the world, or of the motives
which actuate mankind. Never, perhaps,
did a man attain so high a
point of literary distinction without
possessing in a moderate degree
the power of affecting the passions.
We can scarcely refer to a single
passage out of his whole writings,
whether in prose or verse, which
is likely to have drawn a tear. His
speeches, as we now read them,
are remarkably frigid. They may
satisfy the understanding, but they
never could influence the will. We
are well aware that, in the House
of Commons, as presently constituted,
no speech, however eloquent,
can be supposed to affect the votes of
any considerable section; but the
peculiarity of Mr Macaulay’s speaking
is this, that we can hardly conceive
the possibility of his making a convert.
This is owing, we think, in a
great measure, to a somewhat singular
disregard—for we cannot suppose it
ignorance—of the means which the
chief orators, both of ancient and
modern times have deemed it their
duty to employ. In the first place,
Mr Macaulay never seems to think it
necessary to take the slightest pains
to conciliate his audience. Of course
there are many cases when such introductory
conciliation is not required—for
example, when addressing an
entirely sympathetic meeting, or when
retorting upon the direct attack of an
antagonist—but in very few instances
indeed does Mr Macaulay
introduce himself, upon a debated
point, otherwise than as a determined
partisan. There can be no doubt that
introductions of a conciliatory nature
require the utmost delicacy of handling.
They are made for the purpose
of showing that the speaker comes to
the consideration of the question at
issue, with as much fairness, deliberation,
and candour, as can be expected
from man of mortal mould;
and further, that he does not intend
to dictate to his audience, but rather,
by impressing them with his own
views, to induce them to consider
calmly whether his conclusions are
true or false. This does not imply
the abandonment of the strongest
argument, or the most forcible illustration
in the after-part of the speech.
It is an arrangement dictated by
nature; because in every case, when
a man rises to address an assembly,
his first care ought to be to dispel,
if possible, personal suspicion if that
should exist, and to secure a willing
auditory. Of this art Cicero was an
entire master; and it is no exaggeration
to say, that his most remarkable
forensic triumphs were achieved rather
by the effect of his introductions, than
by the subsequent ingenuity of his
arguments, and his unrivalled skill in
the disposition of narrative. We are
quite aware that introductions of this
kind, when badly framed, have exactly
the opposite effect from that which
was intended. There probably never
was a worse one than that attempted
by the late Sir Robert Peel, in his
memorable speech delivered in the
House of Commons on 27th January
1846, in which he beat about the
bush so long, that he entirely destroyed
the effect which he intended
to produce. But, whether as regards
the immediate impression on the
House, or the subsequent effect on
the country, we must hold that a
speaker ought to endeavour, in the
first instance, to divest himself of the
appearance of being actuated by mere
party motives. Such men as the late
Duke of Wellington, or the present
Marquis of Lansdowne, whose long
and unblemished public lives have
been accepted as full evidence of the
purity of their motives, might indeed
dispense with any such protestation;
but there are not many who, from
age and public confidence, have
acquired a similar privilege. Now, it
is rather curious to observe that Mr
Macaulay seems, throughout his whole
career, to have disdained any kind of
conciliation. He has approached every
question, not only with his mind made
up upon it, but in the spirit of the
strongest contempt and depreciation
towards all who disagreed with him.
He never, like Themistocles, volunteered
to receive a buffet in order to
gain a hearing. He rather, in imitation
of Dares, walked into the arena
with the gauntlets buckled round his
wrists,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And dealt in empty air his whistling blows.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is no business of ours to recount
how often he has met with an Entellus,
who has doled out severe punishment;
we are now simply referring to
what we consider to be his oratorical
deficiencies or omissions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next we would observe, that the
impression left on our mind by the
perusal of these Speeches—which, referring
as they do to bygone events,
do not excite the slightest feeling of
antagonism—is that the value of the
matter is generally disproportioned to
the grandiose nature of the style, and
the uniform pomposity of language. It
is quite true, that Mr Macaulay has
spoken upon several interesting and
important questions; and it is equally
true that an orator, in addressing himself
to themes of that description, is
entitled to assume a higher tone than
might be suitable to a meaner subject
of debate. But then, he must take
care that his thoughts and sentiments
are raised to the like elevation. One
distinguishing quality of the real orator
is, that he rises with his subject. His
intellect seems to expand in proportion
to the greatness of his theme—he
elevates himself in feeling and energy
above the level of his audience, and
the high thoughts which then rush
upon his mind are expressed with
corresponding dignity. The orator,
like the poet, has his fits of inspiration,
varying in intensity and degree
according to the subject with which
he deals. This, of course, precludes
that method of slavish preparation,
now unfortunately too common, by
means of which not only the substance
of the speech, but the very words,
are elaborately fabricated in the closet,
and committed to memory. The man
who adopts that system may be a
good speaker, but he never will attain
the highest point of elevation as an
orator. Like the swimmer on a stormy
sea, the orator should rise and fall
with the wave of his audience; for he
is contending for the mastery over a
moral element, than which the natural
one is not always more fluctuating or
fierce. It may be well to calculate
and consider beforehand the line of
argument to be adopted, just as a prudent
general will make his dispositions
before going into battle. But as no
commander can foresee what may
happen in the field, can provide for
every emergency, or lay down for himself
a course of action from which he
will not deviate—so neither ought the
orator to commit himself to a certain
form of words, which possibly may
prove either unappropriate to the occasion,
or injurious to his cause. Men
think differently in the closet, and in
the scene of action. In the former
they are comparatively unimpassioned—in
the latter they must necessarily
exhibit passion if they seek to rouse
it in others. The most skilful and
elaborate discourse, if coldly conceived
and expressed, will have a drenching
rather than an inspiring effect
upon an audience which is already
possessed with a considerable degree
of enthusiasm. Their feeling, favourable
to the speaker and his cause,
must not be put back—it ought, on
the contrary, to be heightened. The
force of these observations will become
apparent to every one who will take
pains to investigate the subject, for
there is nothing more certain, than
that the success of an orator depends
mainly upon the amount of energy
which he can display. Energy was
the secret of the success of Demosthenes;
and Cicero, with all his art,
could not find a higher quality to recommend.
It must be confessed that
modern statesmen have been too
much in the habit of disregarding this
evident truth. Some of them—and we
would instance as a notable example
the late Sir Robert Peel—might have
secured a far more enthusiastic following
than they ever could boast, but
for their extreme and over-cautious
frigidity. To this remark Lord John
Russell, who perhaps has had more
opportunities than any other living
man of acquiring personal influence,
is also peculiarly liable. On the contrary,
take the case of Lord Palmerston.
He is not implicitly trusted by
any strong party in the state; and
yet, in the House of Commons, no
man can produce a greater effect, or
possesses a larger personal influence.
And why is this? Because he can
carry an audience along with him—because
he is never frigid, never dull,
never addicted to circumlocution—because
he possesses and exerts
energy in a high degree; and is, in
truth, what few of his contemporaries
can claim to be—an orator. Read
one of his speeches, and you see at
once that it was not concocted in the
closet—that he had not stooped to
polish sentences beforehand, or to
select language which should pass for
a pattern of composition. Mark, too,
the variety of his style—how quietly
and playfully he disposes of a small
matter—how, during debate and attack,
to use the language of Canning,
he “silently concentrates the power
to be put forth on an adequate occasion.”
No wonder that, when the
occasion arrives, he should extort
admiration even from his adversaries.
Very different is the case with Mr
Macaulay. Whatever be the subject,
he rises to lecture, and has his lecture
thoroughly prepared. He is speaking
to-night, amidst the hum of the House
of Commons, what he wrote yesterday
in the quiet seclusion of his
chambers in the Albany. He had no
thought whatever of his audience; he
was thinking simply of his style.
That he may adorn and heighten;
but he cannot vary it at pleasure.
Ask him to pronounce a panegyric
upon a deceased hero, and a discourse
upon a drowned mouse, and he will
execute both in the same strain. The
victor in a hundred fields will not
be celebrated in periods more stately
than the invader of a hundred cheeses.
Simplicity is not part of his nature—he
must have recourse to rhetoric or
be dumb.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, although this style may be
tolerated in writing, it becomes very
tedious when adopted in public speaking.
Dress up a mere commonplace
with the utmost skill and ingenuity,
and yet, to the hearer, it retains its
original character. The way in which
a thing is said, does not alter the substance
of the thing itself—the fine
features cannot conceal the emaciation
of the body beneath. We have
gone over several of the speeches contained
in this volume, for the purpose
of ascertaining the real value, power,
and ingenuity of the arguments set
forth; and we are compelled to say,
that in no one instance have we been
able to discover the trace of an independent
thought, or of a purely original
idea. Some of them are unquestionably
able speeches. Ask a man
of high talent and extensive information,
like Mr Macaulay, to deliver a
discourse upon any possible theme,
and he will do so in a manner which
shall elicit shouts of applause from a
Mechanic’s Institute. Nay, he will
be loudly cheered even within the
walls of Parliament, provided that a
considerable interval is allowed to
elapse between each exhibition—because,
as we know from the history of
Euphuism, fine language commands
admiration, and rounded periods are
always grateful to the ear. Besides
this, it would be untrue, and highly
unfair to Mr Macaulay to insinuate
that he cannot make proper use and
disposition of such arguments as lie
before him. He states them well and
adroitly; though, as we have already
hinted, frequently marring their effect
by the extreme remoteness of his illustrations.
But neither our reading nor
our recollection can furnish us with one
case in which Mr Macaulay has put
forth an original view, or disentangled
himself from the general mass of debaters.
In political life or strife, he
appears simply as a furbisher of old
iron, a process in which he certainly
is expert; and he manages to make
an exceedingly rusty rapier pass for
a tolerable Toledo. More he seldom
attempts.  His speeches are often
brilliant, in the same sense in which
we apply the epithet to fireworks;
tolerably, though not strictly logical;
always sententious, rounded, and
adapted to a mouthing delivery—but
never ardent, never eloquent, never
calculated to excite enthusiasm. If
mere rhetoric could make an orator,
Mr Macaulay ought undoubtedly to be
the first of the age. He has studied
it on the same principle as did Gorgias,
who made it his boast that he could
speak, and speak well upon any given
subject, even though he was not conversant
with its details, by aid of the
commonplaces which he could dress
up for the occasion. Gorgias had some
reputation during his lifetime, but he
is now remembered only on account
of his extravagant boast. His works
have long since perished; and we do
not think that the efforts of Mr Macaulay,
as an orator, will survive even
so long as those of Gorgias.</p>

<p class='c010'>If there had been, in this collection,
one speech upon which we could have
dwelt with any feeling of artistic interest—one
which we could have withdrawn
from the rest, to rank among the
remarkable specimens of British eloquence—we
should not only have been
delighted, but proud to have selected
it for eulogy. That which we have
perused with the most pleasure, on
account of its sentiment and manly
feeling, is the speech delivered in 1846
upon the subject of the Ten Hours’
Bill. Regarded merely as an oration,
it may not be of high value; but it
displays, in a most pleasing light, the
genuine kindness of his heart, his
strong sympathy with suffering, and
his genuine hatred of oppression. Such
speeches are worthy of record, because
they rank in the category of good deeds
and noble actions; and deserve to be
remembered with gratitude as exertions
in the cause of humanity. We
do not inquire now into the abstract
merit of the speeches of Wilberforce,
nor does his fame depend at all upon
his oratorical skill. He has passed
from the roll of speakers to the catalogue
of philanthropists; and instead
of directing the attention of youthful
aspirants after public distinction to
the force of his style, or the energy
of his expression, we pay homage to
his memory as the chief instrument,
under Providence, of removing the
fetters from the slave. In like manner,
notwithstanding certain peculiarities
which lead us rather to admire
than to love, Mr Macaulay has high
claims to the public gratitude and respect.
In open questions, and those
in which party considerations do not
materially interfere, he has always
shown himself accessible to conviction,
generous in his views, and just
in the expression of his sentiments.
There are, among living public men,
some who are more genial and attractive;
but there are not many who
are better entitled to our respect.
Our criticism has been framed utterly
irrespective of politics. We cannot
boast, at the present day, of so large
a list of men, either of genius or
of high talent, as to omit the opportunity
of paying tribute, where tribute
is justly due. “I hope that I
am,” says Mr Macaulay, in the last
sentence of his last recorded speech,
“at once a Liberal and a Conservative
politician.” We hope so too; and we
hope, moreover, that the avowal was
made—not because Lord Aberdeen
and Lord Palmerston, Lord John
Russell and Mr Gladstone, Sir William
Molesworth and Mr Sidney Herbert,
have agreed to lie down together—but
because Mr Macaulay wishes
henceforward to emancipate himself
from party trammels. It is certainly
time that he should do so. He has
occupied a subordinate rank in the
Whig regiment longer than he ought
to have done for his own reputation;
and we are not sorry to see this disclaimer
put forth in so marked a manner
at the very end of his last publication.
It is, like the reading of the
closing line of the Iliad in the famous
manuscript copy, which the supporters
of the Cyclic theory point to as clearly
indicative of further action, a phrase
fraught with meaning; and when the
coalition is dissolved, as it soon must
be by the influence of a political thaw,
we trust that Mr Macaulay’s tendencies
may indeed appear to be Conservative,
without the sacrifice of the
true liberality which becomes the
gentleman and the scholar. We do
not believe that the general verdict
of the public upon this collection will
be of a different tenor from our own.
But, after all, Mr Macaulay has no
great reason to repine because he has
failed to achieve a high place in the
roll of British orators. His speeches
will not be quoted for their eloquence
and power, as those of Burke, Grattan,
Erskine, and Canning are; but his history
and essays, and even ballads, will
insure him a reputation not less extensive
and enduring. We need scarcely
remind him that men who have attained
high reputations as statesmen, and
been conspicuous as public speakers,
have altogether failed in their attempts
to found a literary name. No one who
has perused the historical chapters composed
by Fox, can regret that his design
proved abortive, and that the
subject has been left to the more
brilliant and dexterous treatment of
Macaulay. We cannot say with truth
that Lord John Russell’s literary
efforts inspire us with an exalted idea
of the author’s powers—we are even
of opinion that he would have done
well in abstaining from appearing
before the public, either as a dramatist,
biographer, or editor. <i><span lang="la">Ne sutor
ultra crepidam.</span></i> It is by natural
instinct that every man addresses
himself to the occupation in which he
is qualified to excel; and that ambition
which prompts men to deviate
from their destiny, and undertake
tasks which are not congenial to their
feelings and sympathies, ought to be
repressed. We cannot view Mr Macaulay’s
career without being convinced
that nature designed him to play his
part as a literary man rather than as a
politician. He has indeed tacitly admitted
that; for he has withdrawn
himself very much of late years from
debate, preferring literary occupation
to the excitement of political strife.
We are sorry that he has been induced
to interrupt his more interesting
labours for the sake of undertaking
this collection; for, although the
volume will find its way into many
libraries—as what volume that bore
his name upon the title-page would
not?—it will be regarded hereafter
with little interest, and may possibly
be cited as an instance of unsuccessful
ambition. We repeat that Mr Macaulay’s
fame rests upon his writings,
and that the publication of his speeches
is by no means calculated to extend
or heighten his intellectual reputation;
though it cannot diminish the just estimation
in which he is held as a man.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>The memoirs of a man of a singularly
adventurous and speculative
turn, who, having entered upon the
occupations of manhood early, and
retained its energies late, has prolonged
the active period of his life to
upwards of half a century, who has
been an eyewitness of not a few of
the important events that occurred in
Europe and America between the
years 1796 and 1850, and himself a
sharer in more than one of them, who
has been associated or an agent in
some of the largest commercial and
financial operations that British and
Dutch capital and enterprise ever
ventured upon, and has been brought
into contact and acquaintance—not
unfrequently into intimacy—with a
number of the remarkable men of his
time, can hardly, one would imagine,
be otherwise than highly interesting,
if the author have but sufficient command
of his native tongue plainly to
write down what his memory has retained,
sufficient discrimination and
self-restraint to avoid dwelling upon
details of too trifling and egotistical a
nature. Generally speaking, we have
but little confidence in the interesting
qualities of German septuagenarian
autobiographers. Garrulity is the
privilege of age, and German garrulity
is a grievous thing, particularly
when it displays itself upon paper.
In Germany, where nearly everybody
capable of grammar writes a book,
even though he have nothing to write
about, elderly gentlemen, who really
have seen something worth the telling,
are apt to imagine they can
never make too much of it, and instead
of delighting us with the pure
spirit, drench us with a feeble dilution.
Such was the case, we well remember,
with our old acquaintance,
Baron von Rahden, whose military
experiences during the stirring period
of 1813–14–15 we brought before our
readers now just seven years since,
and who, instead of cutting short the
tolerably prolix history of his life and
adventures at the date when peace
sheathed his sword, elaborated two
other ponderous and very wearisome
volumes, scarcely relieved by an account
of General Chassé’s defence of
Antwerp, and by sketches of a campaign
in Catalonia, in which the indefatigable
and restless old fire-eater,
unable to pass his latter days in tranquillity,
served under the orders of
the Carlist general Cabrera. There
is more variety and vivacity in the
book now before us than in the
baron’s interminable record, of which,
however, it has in some respects reminded
us. Von Rahden, a soldier
by profession and inclination, gave us
far too much of his proceedings in
times of peace, and dwelt at tedious
length on garrison rivalries, his own
unrewarded merit, and German provincial
topics. Mr Nolte, on the
contrary, by profession a man of
peace, whose weapon is the pen, his
field of battle the Exchange, and his
campaigns amongst cotton bales,
whose tutelar deity has been Mercury
instead of Mars, and whose commanders
and allies, instead of the martial-sounding
appellations of Blucher,
Gneisenau, and Chassé, have borne
the pacific but scarcely less famous
names of Hope, Labouchere, and
Baring, has mingled, in the rather
complicated narrative of his mercantile
pursuits, triumphs, and disasters,
much adventure both by flood and
field, in which he himself was personally
engaged, and displays, in the
telling, not a little of the go-ahead
spirit proper to the people amongst
whom he has passed a large portion
of his life. He has really seen a
great deal, and his reminiscences, although
here and there his style of
narrating them be trivial and in questionable
taste—whilst some of his
long accounts of financial and commercial
operations will more particularly
interest bankers and merchants
than the general reader—contain
much that will attract all. In
Germany the first edition of his book
has gone off at a gallop,—no small
testimony to its merits in a year during
which present politics have been
the all-absorbing topic. We do not
wonder at its popularity; for, besides
the mass of anecdote and historical
recollections it comprises, the author
has contrived to give an interest to
his individuality, by the off-hand
style in which he tells of his errors
and of his triumphs, of his many reverses
and disasters, as well as of
his rarer moments of prosperity and
success.</p>

<p class='c010'>We should as soon think of attempting,
within the compass of an
article, a digest of an encyclopædia
as of Mr Nolte’s volumes. We should
fill half a magazine by merely tracing
his itinerary. There never was
such a rolling stone. He treats the
Atlantic as most men do Dover
Straits, and thinks no more of a few
hundred leagues of land travel than a
modern Cockney of a run to Ramsgate.
Whole years of his life must
have been passed on board ship, and
behind post-horses. His book necessarily
partakes of the desultory
nature of his career. It better bears
dipping into than reading from end
to end.</p>

<p class='c010'>Born at Leghorn, in the year 1779,
of a German father, Mr Vincent
Nolte’s first reminiscence, of much
interest to his readers, is connected
with the invasion of Italy by the
French under Buonaparte. His father
had for some years left Italy, and settled
in Hamburg, his native place;
but young Vincent, after being educated
in Germany, was sent back to
Leghorn, to take his place as junior
clerk in his uncle’s counting-house,
one of the most important in that city.
He was in his seventeenth year when,
upon the last Saturday in June 1796,
a courier from the British minister at
Florence brought news to the consul
at Leghorn that the French were approaching.
There was great bustle
amongst the English merchants to get
their property shipped, and place it
and themselves under the protection
of Nelson’s squadron, then cruising
off the port. After unremitting labour,
and favoured by the wind, the
last ships, with English goods on
board, left the harbour at noon on
Monday. They had been but two
hours gone, when it suddenly became
known in the city that the French
were close at hand, advancing by the
Pisa road, and presently a party of
cavalry galloped round the fortifications
to the <em>Porta Colonella</em>, and rode
straight up to the fort, on which the
Tuscan flag waved. Suddenly those
colours disappeared, and were replaced
by the French tricolor, displayed for
the first time to the wondering eyes
of the Tuscans. Almost at the same
moment the cannon of the fort thundered,
and sent some shots after those
English vessels nearest to the harbour—thus
signalling to Nelson the
entrance of the French. Young Nolte,
who had little love for the desk, whose
wish it was to become a painter, and
who then, and all his life through,
was ardent, impetuous, and a lover of
excitement, could sit still no longer,
but ran out of the respectable counting-house
of Otto Franck &#38; Co., consul
for Hamburg, &#38;c., to stare at the
invaders. At the head of a body of
cavalry, a horseman of remarkable
beauty galloped up the street, and
alighted at the door of the Genevese
banker, Dutremoul. It was Murat.
This was between two and three in
the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At six in the evening, the news
spread that General Buonaparte was
at the Pisa gate. No sooner did he
learn that the English residents had
had time to escape with their property,
than he broke into a violent
rage. At that moment Count Spannochi,
attired in the ordinary uniform,
a blue coat, red waistcoat, and white
breeches (the full-dress uniform consisted
of a white coat and red waistcoat
and breeches), and, surrounded
by his officers, and by the chief authorities
of the city, advanced to welcome
the general, who still sat upon his
horse. Buonaparte gave him no time
to speak, but at once violently assailed
him. ‘How dare you,’ he cried,
‘appear before me thus? Do you not
know your duty? You are an insolent
fellow, a traitor! You have let
the English escape; you shall pay for
that. A court-martial shall sit immediately.
You are my prisoner—give
up your sword!’ And Count Spannochi
disappeared. Buonaparte’s
words were repeated to me that same
evening by my fellow-clerk, Giacomini,
who had gone with the crowd
outside the Pisa gate, and had heard
them. Next day we learned that the
governor had been sent under arrest
to Florence, and that the French
general, Vaubois, commanded in his
stead. Hardly had Buonaparte and
his staff reached the grand-ducal palace,
when police-agents went round
to all the houses, ordering a general
illumination, under heavy penalties in
case of disobedience. The only Leghorn
newspaper that then existed announced,
upon the following day, the
arrival of the victor of Lodi and Arcola,
adding, that the inhabitants had
<em>spontaneously</em> illuminated. I then,
for the first time, got a correct idea
of a <em>spontaneous illumination</em>, and was
never afterwards at a loss to understand
the expression. At eleven
o’clock the next morning, the foreign
consuls waited upon the general, who
quickly dismissed them, when suddenly
his eye was attracted by my uncle’s
red coat. ‘What is that?’ he cried.
‘An English uniform?’ My uncle,
taken quite aback, had just enough
presence of mind to reply, ‘<i><span lang="it">No, Padrone,
questa e l’uniforme di Amburgo!</span></i>’
and endeavoured, but in vain,
to make his escape. Buonaparte
burst forth with a violent diatribe
against everything that looked English,
against all who thought like
Englishmen, or had anything to do
with England. ‘Those English,’ he
said, according to my uncle’s account
to me upon his return home, ‘shall
get such a lesson as they have never
yet had! My road now lies to Vienna,
then farther north, to destroy
their nests in Hamburg and elsewhere,
and then to seek them in their own
robbers’ den!’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Young Nolte was bent upon seeing
the hero of the day, who, before attaining
his eight-and-twentieth year,
had played such havoc amongst Austria’s
veteran commanders, and, disregarding
his uncle’s commands to
keep in-doors, and out of the way of
the dense mob upon the <em>Piazza
d’Arme</em>, he again played truant, and
stationed himself at the corner of the
palace, at whose entrance an open
carriage awaited the French general.
His account of the impression he carried
away of Napoleon’s appearance
has some originality. The peculiar
expression, attributed by him to the
eyes, reminds one of the present
French Emperor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At last there came out, accompanied
by a number of officers, a
little, youthful-looking man, in a plain
uniform, with a pale, almost a yellow
complexion, and long, lank, raven-black
hair, hanging over his ears,
after the fashion of the Florida savages
called <em>Talapouches</em>. That was
the hero of Arcola! Whilst he took
the right-hand place in the carriage,
and whilst his aides-de-camp got in,
I had a few moments to observe him
closely. There was a continued smile
round his mouth, with which, however,
the man himself had evidently
nothing to do, for the fixed indifferent
look of his eyes showed that
the mind was busy elsewhere. I
never again beheld so remarkable an
expression. It was the dull gaze of a
mummy, barring a certain beam of
intelligence betraying the inward life,
but only by a faint and glimmering
gleam. Macbeth’s words to Banquo’s
ghost, ‘There is no speculation in
those eyes!’ would almost have fitted
here, had not previous and subsequent
events sufficiently shown what
a spirit lurked behind those impressive
orbs. The carriage drove away—seven
years elapsed before I again
beheld that extraordinary man. He
left the town the next day. I must
not omit to mention a colossal and
well-built officer, who stood, in a
respectful attitude, beside the carriage-door.
This man, who had just
been named town-major of Leghorn,
was the grenadier who, seven
years previously, on the 14th July
1789, led the storm of the Bastile,
and was the first to scale its walls,
who afterwards, as General Hullin,
was governor of Berlin after the
battle of Jena, and presided over
the court-martial appointed to try, or
rather to shoot, the unfortunate Duke
d’Enghien.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The presence and proceedings of
the French in Leghorn were alike
odious to the inhabitants, who found
an important branch of their trade—that
with England—completely cut
off, and who had to satisfy unceasing
demands for money and equipments.
Large bodies of ragged, barefooted
troops continually entered the town,
to quit it well shod and with new
uniforms. The republican cockade
became an abomination in the eyes of
the Leghornese, who christened it <i><span lang="it">il
pasticcino</span></i>—the little pie—and wrote
innumerable lampoons upon its wearers.
Leghorn was converted into a
camp, and on a large altar in the
middle of the <i><span lang="co">Piazza d’Arme</span></i>, a statue
of Liberty was erected, at the foot
of which the popular representatives,
Garat and Salicetti, daily harangued
the troops upon parade. Business
was at a standstill; Vincent Nolte
deserted his desk and roamed about
the town, sketching the groups of
foreign soldiers. And even when
things began to settle down, he would
do nothing but ramble in picture-galleries
and make love to pretty
Florentines, until at last his uncle,
despairing of his doing any good,
wrote to his father that he was on
the high-road to perdition. This
alarming piece of information produced
an instant summons to Hamburg,
where, in the paternal counting-house,
the young scamp amended his
ways and applied earnestly to business,
displaying great energy, industry,
and capacity.</p>

<p class='c010'>The year 1799 was a disastrous
one for Hamburg. Within six weeks
there occurred upwards of one hundred
and thirty failures for a total of
thirty-six millions of marks. The
panic was universal, and trade was
shaken to its foundations. Mr Nolte’s
house weathered the storm, but was
compelled, three years later, to suspend
its payments in consequence of the
failure of the Leghorn establishment.
The creditors received eighty-five per
cent, and the numerous friends of the
unfortunate merchant subscribed a
capital of one hundred and twenty
thousand marks to start him again in
business. Upon the list figured the
well-known name of Francis Baring,
a former schoolfellow of the insolvent’s,
for the munificent sum of
twenty thousand marks, upon which
he positively refused to receive interest.
Thus supported, Mr Nolte
again applied himself to business.
But he was then a man advanced in
years and of little enterprise, and his
son, bold and ambitious, saw that he
was not likely to strike out new paths
to wealth, whereas the old and ordinary
avenues to commercial profits
were then closed, all over the European
continent, by the iron hand of
Napoleon, that mortal foe to trade,
and contemner of its votaries. And
as young Nolte could be of no use to
his father, who despised his views as
the dreams of a stripling, bent upon
pleasure and unworthy of attention,
he sought employment abroad. This
he found in the house of Labouchere
and Trotreau at Nantes, where he
accepted an engagement for three
years, to carry on the German and
English correspondence. And so, in
his twenty-fifth year, he took leave of
his parents, with a heavy heart, he
says, but without uneasiness as to
the future, and travelled, by way of
Bremen, to Paris.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Nolte’s arrival in the French
capital coincided with the proclamation
of Napoleon as emperor, and
with Moreau’s imprisonment on the
charge of a plot against the government
and life of the First Consul. It
was his first visit to Paris—the period
was interesting. He was so fortunate
as to find a friend who willingly
undertook to be his cicerone, and a
few weeks flew rapidly by, during
which, thanks to his guide’s familiarity
with places and persons, he acquired
a better knowledge of both than he
would in as many months had he
been left to himself; for it would
have served him little (except, perhaps,
in the way of emptying his
pockets) that the doors of Frascati’s,
then the favourite resort of the Parisian
fashionable world, were open
to all who could pay for admission,
and who chose to roam through its
gorgeous saloons and brilliantly illuminated
gardens, had he not had with
him some one able to inform him that
yonder beautiful woman was Madame
Recamier—yonder elegant young
man, leaning against the pedestal of
a statue, the renowned ball-room
hero Trénis—and the one beyond
him, with a music-book in his hand,
the celebrated singer Garat. But of
all that Mr Nolte saw and heard,
nothing made a deeper impression
upon him than the lively and universal
interest taken in the fate of
Moreau. “Rarely,” he says, “was
that name uttered by the middle and
lower classes without an expression
of love and respect, and without a
curse upon his two implacable persecutors,
the First Consul, and the governor
of Paris, General Murat, whose
proclamations exhibited at every
street corner the name of Moreau in
juxtaposition with the words—‘Traitor
to the Republic.’ Men could not
and would not credit the guilt of the
distinguished general; and the Paris
wits, never at a loss, declared that
there were but two parties in France,
‘<i><span lang="fr">les moraux</span></i> (Moreaus) <i><span lang="fr">et les immoraux</span></i>’—a
saying which one heard
everywhere repeated.” Condemned
to banishment, the conqueror of Hohenlinden
betook himself, by way of
Cadiz, to the United States, where
Mr Nolte some years afterwards met
him, and made his acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Nolte was present at the first
review passed by the new emperor,
on the Place du Carrousel at Paris.
He was very desirous to get a near
view of the victorious general and
successful adventurer, whom he had
first seen, seven years before, in the
full flush of triumph at Leghorn.
Two officers of the Danish life-guards,
with whom he had travelled from
Bremen, made interest for him with
their ambassador, and procured him
admission to the gallery of the Louvre,
a favour granted to few. “I saw
the great man of the day, surrounded
by a brilliant staff, and by uniforms
of every kind, ride several times up
and down through the ranks, then
gallop full speed along the front of
the lines of cavalry drawn up outside
the inner court, amidst cries of ‘<i><span lang="fr">Vive
l’Empereur!</span></i>’  when suddenly his
horse fell, and Napoleon rolled upon
the ground, still grasping the bridle
tightly. In a few seconds he had
mounted again, and galloped on,
before even a part of his staff, who
quickly dismounted, could go to his
assistance. The newspapers said nothing
of this incident, and its ominous
character struck me the more by
reason of their silence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief partner of the mercantile
house into whose employment Mr
Nolte now entered, was a younger
brother of the late P. C. Labouchere,
of the celebrated house of Hope of
Amsterdam. Mr A. M. Labouchere
was very desirous to extend his connection
and business with the United
States, but did not seem fully to appreciate
the facilities for so doing
afforded him by his close alliance
with the Hopes and Barings, whose
names appeared as references in the
circulars of the Nantes house. Nolte,
whose energy and talent early earned
him a considerable share of his employer’s
confidence, urged Mr Labouchere
to send an agent to the
States to carry out his wishes, and
offered to go himself, if no better was
to be found. He was told to put
upon paper his ideas concerning America,
and concerning the advantages
to be derived from a journey thither.
This statement he executed in a manner
to excite the warm approval of
Mr Labouchere, who desired him to
forward it to his brother in Amsterdam.
The reply was a summons to
the Dutch capital. There the elder
Labouchere, who had formed a high
opinion of Nolte from his correspondence,
unfolded to him a gigantic project,
the mere sketch of which bewildered
him; and although not diffident
of his own powers, he declared that
he did not hold himself sufficiently
experienced to undertake such responsibility,
and felt that he should not be
able to come up to his employer’s
expectations. “That is my business,
and not yours,” Mr Labouchere replied.
“I have but one thing to
recommend to you, and that is, never
to do aught that shall give you cause
to blush before me or before yourself.”
This was lightening the load of responsibility
from which the young
man shrank, and giving him fresh
confidence by showing him that others
appreciated him more highly than he
did himself, and he no longer made
objections. He was to go to the
United States, and for a few months
merely to look around him and acquire
a knowledge of the country.
Before entering, however, which he
does at great length, into an account
of the important business about to be
confided to him, and into whose details
he was not initiated until some
time afterwards, he gives an amusing
chapter to a sketch of the celebrated
banker and contractor Ouvrard, from
whose combinations the proposed operation
issued, and with whom Mr
Nolte was well acquainted, and had
frequent intercourse at several periods
of his life. The chapter includes some
curious traits and anecdotes of Napoleon,
who, it is well known, detested
Ouvrard, and tyrannised over him,
although he was more than once
obliged to seek his aid. Napoleon
notoriously hated and despised traders
and bankers. “I do not like
merchants!” he is reported to have
said—with that <em>brusquerie</em> which, in
a less man, would have been designated
as brutal ill-breeding—to the
deputation from the merchants of
Antwerp that went to welcome him
to the town; “a merchant is a man
who would sell his country for a three-franc
piece!” He was jealous of, or
at least indignant at, Ouvrard’s enormous
wealth, and the influence it
gave him—both of which he considered
too great for any private person
to possess; but, according to Mr
Nolte, who seems quite conversant
with the scandalous chronicles of any
day during the last half-century,
there were other private causes of
irritation, which most of Napoleon’s
biographers either were ignorant of,
or thought it unnecessary to mention,
and which certainly are less
out of place in the present author’s
far from prudish pages than they
would be in a grave biography.
Ouvrard’s own Memoirs, published
nearly thirty years ago,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c008'><sup>[11]</sup></a> are now
little remembered; and Mr Nolte is
evidently indebted to them for the
outline of his sketch, as well as for
several incidents and anecdotes, but
he has filled up details which the great
speculator thought proper to omit.
The relative positions of Ouvrard and
Napoleon, at different periods of their
lives, present the strangest contrasts.
When the former, quitting the army
in which he had for a short time
served, applied himself with skill and
success to commercial and speculative
operations, and quickly realised a fortune
of several millions of francs, Napoleon
was so needy as to be desirous
to avail himself of a decree of the Committee
of Public Safety, by which officers
were entitled to receive as much
cloth as would make them a uniform.
The anecdote is well known. Napoleon’s
application was rejected because
he was not just then employed, and
he was very glad when Ouvrard, with
whom he had become acquainted at
the house of the Director Barras, induced
Madame Tallien, whose lover
the capitalist then was, to give him a
letter of recommendation to the commissary
of the 17th military division;
a letter which procured young Buonaparte
what he had great need of—a
new uniform. Subsequently, in Napoleon’s
days of power and magnificence,
when he began to spite and squeeze
Ouvrard, the latter loved to tell this
anecdote—a contrast with Talma,
who had been Napoleon’s intimate,
and had often lent him money in his
days of penury, and who became ever
more reserved in his communications
and behaviour the higher his friend
ascended upon fortune’s ladder. To
Ouvrard Napoleon was unquestionably
harsh, cruel, and unjust. His
dislike to him seemed to augment in a
direct ratio with the magnitude of the
gains which the capitalist owed to
the circumstances of the times, to his
great financial capacity, and to the
vastness of his operations. Of the
extent of these and of his profits, we
may form some idea from a passage
in Mr Nolte’s book, where he states
positively that Ouvrard cleared six
hundred thousand pounds sterling by
his contract for victualling the Spanish
fleet under Mazaredo when it lay at
Brest, and afterwards at Cadiz. But
if his gains were large, his losses,
arising chiefly from Napoleon’s ill-will
and despotic acts, were also
heavy. During the Egyptian campaign,
the Directory borrowed ten
millions of francs from him, which he
produced with the greatest ease. After
Buonaparte’s return and the fall of
the Directory, the First Consul asked
him for twelve millions more. Ouvrard
declined. The other Paris bankers
were applied to; they either could
not or would not. The First Consul
was furious—doubly so when Ouvrard
claimed repayment of the ten millions
lent to the Directory. He had him
paid in assignments on the revenue
of the past year, which had all been
expended. It was equivalent to a
repudiation of the debt. Soon afterwards,
Ouvrard was arrested, under
pretext of fraud in his dealings with
the government and supply of the
French navy. He was kept in strict
confinement, his papers were sealed
up, and a committee of councillors of
state was appointed to investigate his
affairs. Nothing could be substantiated
against him, but it was ascertained
that his fortune, in landed property,
money and French <i><span lang="fr">rentes</span></i>, (then
worth but 15 per cent) amounted to
twenty-seven millions of francs. “On
this occasion,” says Mr Nolte, quoting
almost the words of Ouvrard, “a
discovery was made which deeply
wounded the First Consul—namely,
that, during his absence in Egypt,
Ouvrard had supplied Josephine, who
was an old friend of his, and who had
remained at Malmaison, with money.
She had become his debtor to a considerable
amount. This circumstance,
combined with the refusal of the
twelve millions, inspired Buonaparte
with the most violent antipathy to
Ouvrard, at whose arrest all Paris
(especially the bankers) was indignant
and loud in complaint. Collot,
afterwards director of the mint, who
was one of the First Consul’s most
intimate advisers, did not scruple to
tell him that it was beginning badly,
thus to let all apprehend that they might
in their turn be the victims of such
arbitrary measures. ‘A man,’ replied
Buonaparte ‘who possesses thirty
millions, and sets no value on them,
is much too dangerous for my position.’”
Josephine and other influential
personages interceded for Ouvrard,
who escaped the military tribunal
with which Napoleon threatened
him, and was set at liberty, but remained
under the surveillance of gens-d’armes.
This in no way prevented
his continuing to receive with princely
hospitality at his château of Raincy
(afterwards the Duchess of Berry’s)
the best society of Paris, and the
most distinguished foreigners who
visited that capital—amongst others,
Fox and Lord Erskine, who were his
guests after the peace of Amiens.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we must take Mr Nolte away
from Paris—which seems his favourite
city, but where he can
never linger without getting scandalous—and
across the Atlantic. He
sailed in July 1805, and reached New
York in forty-two days, then a marvellously
rapid passage. The astonished
owner of the American ship
“Flora” could hardly believe his eyes
when he saw her come into port
before he had received advice of her
arrival at Amsterdam. Mr Nolte
found the yellow fever in New York,
and left the place for a few weeks,
but returned thither in time to witness
the arrival in the bay of a vessel from
Cadiz, with General Moreau on board.
The drums beat, and the militia turned
out and formed up in Broadway. As
each company had a different uniform—sometimes
a very odd one—the
effect of the whole display was a good
deal like that produced by a harlequin’s
jacket, which did not prevent
the commander of the motley corps
from being prodigiously proud of his
warriors, and asking Moreau—when
he landed, plainly dressed in a blue
coat, and rode into the town, upon a
horse in waiting for him, amidst cheers
and music, and surrounded by the
variegated staff of the militia—what
he thought of the American troops?
Moreau replied that he had never in
his life seen such soldiers—which he
probably never had. A similar reply
has been since attributed to General
Bertrand, when he landed in the
States some years ago, and a review
was held in his honour. The speculative
spirit of the Yankees, who love
to combine business with pleasure,
and to turn an honest dollar whilst
admiring a hero or listening to a
Lind, slumbered not in 1805 any more
than in 1850. The same genius for
advertisement which made a hatter
pay some hundred dollars for the best
place at the Swedish Nightingale’s
concert, stimulated the promoters of
one that was to be given, on the night
of General Moreau’s arrival, in the
great hall of the City Hotel—then the
first in New York—to beseech his
presence, and, as soon as he had promised
it, to placard his name. The
crowd was tremendous. Moreau, it
was on all hands agreed, looked very
little like a French general, in his
simple dress, without cocked hat,
feather, or embroidery—whereas General
Morton, chief of the militia, had a
most martial aspect in his Washington
uniform. He introduced to the French
leader all who chose, and there was
a prodigious shaking of hands. Mr
Nolte was standing near the two
generals when a Quaker was presented,
who shook Moreau’s hand heartily.
“Glad to see you safe in America,”
quoth Broadbrim. “Pray, general,
do you remember what was the price
of cochineal when you left Cadiz?”
The hero of Hohenlinden shrugged
his shoulders and confessed his ignorance.
It was not until some time
afterwards, in Philadelphia, that Mr
Nolte became personally acquainted
with Moreau, whom he found, he
says, “a mild, agreeable, but, in an
intellectual point of view, upon the
whole, an insignificant and uninteresting
man. His manners were simple,
and possessed a certain naturalness
which was attractive, but his conversation,
or rather his monologue—for
we seldom had long dialogues—fettered
the attention only when its subject
was that of his certainly highly remarkable
and distinguished military
exploits. Then there was pleasure in
listening to him. Of Napoleon he
scarcely ever spoke but as ‘the
tyrant.’” The best portrait—indeed,
the only good one we are acquainted
with—of Moreau, that by Gérard,
conveys quite the same idea here
given of him by Mr Nolte—that of a
mild, amiable, but by no means a
highly intellectual man, with less of
the military air and look about the
head than perhaps in any other distinguished
general of the French
republic or empire.</p>

<p class='c010'>We do not purpose going into the
details of Mr Nolte’s commercial proceedings
as one of Hope’s agents in
America. They were connected with
Ouvrard’s well-known colossal plan
for drawing specie from Mexico, in
whose treasury—owing to the interruption,
by the war with England, of
intercourse between Spain and her colonies—seventy
millions of dollars had
accumulated. The duties assigned to
Mr Nolte compelled him to take up
his quarters at New Orleans, then in
its infancy as a commercial city, and
in the worst possible repute. Louisiana,
after belonging alternately to
France and Spain, and then to France
again, had been but recently sold to
the United States, and three-fifths of
the white population of its capital
were French by birth or extraction.
New Orleans then had about sixteen
thousand inhabitants, one-third of
whom were slaves and coloured people.
The character its citizens enjoyed in
the Northern States may be judged
of by the following anecdote: A friend
of Mr Nolte’s, who had just formed an
establishment at New Orleans, finding
himself at Boston, and seeing a
vessel advertised to sail thence for the
former city, called upon the owner to
ask him to consign the ship to his
house. Whereupon the owner told
him in strict confidence that he had
just as much intention of sending his
vessel to the moon as to New Orleans,
and that he had inserted the advertisement
merely in the expectation
that amongst the persons applying for
a passage he should find a rascal who
had defrauded one of his friends of a
considerable sum. “It is probable,”
he added, “that he will try to get to
New Orleans, that being the natural
rendezvous of all rogues and scoundrels.”
Not one of the eighteen or
twenty commercial houses existing at
New Orleans when Mr Nolte first
went there possessed capital worth the
naming, and a respectable character
was nearly as great a rarity as ready
cash. Roguery, disguised under the
polite name of “cleverness,” was
commonly practised and indulgently
viewed. Juries and authorities were
corrupt, false witnesses easily purchased,
and justice was hard to obtain.
In illustration of this state of things
Mr Nolte tells some curious stories,
one in particular, in which the celebrated
American jurist Edward Livingston
figures. “I well remember,”
he says, “the remarkable trial of a
certain Beleurgey, the editor of one of
the first American newspapers which
appeared in New Orleans, in 1806
and 1807, in French and English,
under the name of <cite><span lang="fr">Le Telegraphe</span></cite>.
To obtain money he had forged the
signature of a rich planter, to whom,
when his crime was discovered, he
wrote, confessing his guilt, and earnestly
entreating him not to prosecute
him. The planter seemed disposed to
accede to his prayer, but the letter
was already in the hands of justice.
How then did Livingston contrive, as
Beleurgey’s counsel and defender, to
obtain his acquittal in spite of that
damning proof of his guilt? Davezac
(Livingston’s brother-in-law and factotum)
brought forward witnesses who
swore that they knew Beleurgey to be
such a liar that no word of truth had
ever issued from his lips. ‘See here,’
then said Livingston to his French
jury—‘it is proved that the man is
incapable of speaking the truth; the
very confession is a lie, for none but
a madman would accuse himself. So
that Beleurgey either has lied or is
out of his senses; in either case he
knew not what he did, and cannot be
found guilty!’ And the jury acquitted
him!” New Orleans was evidently
not a tempting place to settle in, for
an honest man, with money to be
robbed of; but then, with conduct
and judgment, there was money to be
made, and moreover Mr Nolte, as a
mere agent for others, had no choice
but to abide there. Presently the
arrival, in quick succession, of three
fast-sailing schooners from Vera Cruz,
bringing half a million of Mexican dollars
to the address of Vincent Nolte,
drew attention to the young man
whom previously few had heeded—save
the French planters, to whom
his knowledge of their language was
a recommendation. But now boundless
hospitality was shown him, no
party was complete without him, and
for three months he passed a pleasant
enough life, when suddenly the yellow
fever laid him on his back. Upon the
morning of the third day there appeared
at his bedside one Zachary,
the cashier of the Louisiana bank, and
one of the very limited number of
honourable men in the city, and
gravely asked him if he had made his
will. To this ominous inquiry Mr
Nolte replied by a negative and an
interrogative. “No! Why?”—“Well,”
continued Zachary, “I suppose
I need not tell you that you have
got the yellow fever, and that it is
more than possible you will die tomorrow,
for the fourth is the critical
day, which one does not generally get
over. You have large sums lying at
the bank—larger sums than have ever
before been seen here—and, if you die,
the capital will fall into very unsafe
hands. The persons appointed by the
State to take charge of the property
of foreigners dying intestate, are not
only undeserving of confidence, but,
to speak plainly, are downright rascals.”
The sick man’s reply was that
he neither felt inclined nor intended
to die. “And as I am sure not to
die,” he concluded, “I see no use in
bothering my head about my will.”
Zachary looked hard at him. “Well,
my dear Mr Nolte,” he at last said,
“since that is your mood, I too am
certain you will not die,”—a prognostic
justified by the patient’s speedy
recovery. In the yellow fever, as in
other maladies, a faint heart kills
many.</p>

<p class='c010'>We pass over several chapters and
some years. They include a good deal
of interesting matter, and, of course,
abundance of travelling;—a return to
Europe, and brief residences in various
cities of the United States, in London,
Paris, Amsterdam, and Hamburg.
On a voyage from the Havana
to Baltimore, Mr Nolte was wrecked
upon the Carysford reef, which owes
its name to the total loss of the frigate
Carysford in 1774; and he gives a
capital account of his sufferings and
those of his ten companions on a raft
composed of three small spars, six
oars, and a hencoop, half immersed,
and neglected by passing vessels, who
took them for shipwrecked Spaniards,
and feared to succour them, lest, when
rescued, they should rise against their
deliverers and take the ship into Cuba,
an act of ingratitude that had been
recently perpetrated under similar circumstances.
A woodcut of the frail
and curiously-constructed raft is the
only illustration the book contains.
At Philadelphia, Mr Nolte, who, it is
to be observed, has been all his life
an unlucky man, was run away with
in his tandem, and, jumping out, broke
his leg, which, badly set by two ignorant
American Sawbones, occasioned
him terrible suffering and long confinement.
His agency for Hope’s
house at an end, and after declining
two advantageous offers of partnerships
in Europe, one of which he
would perhaps have done wisely in
accepting, he determined to apply the
very liberal sum he had received for
his services to the establishment of a
commercial firm at New Orleans, in
aid of which the houses of Hope and
Baring advanced him funds, opened
him a credit, and allowed him to put
their names in his circular as his
friends and supporters. This brings
us to the most interesting portion of
his book.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Nolte has a habit of interlarding
his German, especially the scraps
of dialogue scattered through his volumes,
with a great deal of English
and French, both of which languages
he evidently understands as well as
his mother-tongue. To readers in the
same case, this practice gives to the
book additional character and pungency;
but to those to whom German
alone is familiar it will prove troublesome,
since he does not subjoin translations.
As an instance of this, we
will give his account of a casual meeting
with a man who has since become
universally celebrated. It was during
his journey on horseback from Philadelphia
to Pittsburg, where he was to
join a friend with whom he had entered
into partnership, and whence
they were to proceed, with a couple
of flat boats laden with flour, two
thousand miles down the Ohio and
Mississippi to New Orleans, there to
form their mercantile establishment.
Steam had not at that date annihilated
distance in America; there were
no boilers bursting on the rivers, or
trains on railroads rattling through the
States, and travelling was slow work,
particularly with goods. The voyage by
flat boats from Pittsburg to New Orleans
was a forty or fifty days’ business.
On a cold December morning,
after a solitary ride over Laurel Hill,
the highest of the Alleghanies, Mr
Nolte halted, towards ten o’clock, at
a small tavern by the falls of the
Juniata river, and asked for a solid
breakfast.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The hostess showed me into a
room, and said I might just take my
food with a strange gentleman who
was seated there already. ‘He is
quite a stranger,’ she said. On stepping
in, the man at once struck me as
being what is commonly called an
odd fellow. He sat at a table, in
front of the fire, with a Madras handkerchief
round his head, after the
fashion of a French sailor, or of labourers
in a French seaport. I courteously
approached him, with the
words:  ‘I hope I don’t incommode
you, by coming to take my breakfast
with you?’ The reply was: ‘No,
sir!’ spoken with a strong French
accent, and sounding like ‘No,
serre.’ ‘Ah!’ I continued, ‘<span lang="fr"><em>vous
êtes Français</em>, Monsieur?</span>’ ‘No,
serre!’ was the reply; ‘ai em en
Henglieshmen’ (I am an Englishman).
‘Why,’ I continued, ‘how do you
make that out? You look like a
Frenchman, and you speak like one.’
‘I am an Englishman, because I got an
English wife,’ replied he, with the
same accent. Without further investigation
of the matter, we agreed,
over our breakfast, to ride together to
Pittsburg. He showed himself more
and more of an oddity, but at last admitted
that he was a born Frenchman,
from La Rochelle, had been brought
to Louisiana when a child, had grown
up in the sea-service, but had gradually
become a real American. ‘Well,’
said I, ‘but how do you reconcile that
with your quality of an Englishman?’
To which he replied, in French at
last: ‘<i><span lang="fr">Au bout du compte, je suis un
peu cosmopolite; j’appartiens à tous
les pays.</span></i>’”</p>

<p class='c010'>When we mention that all the dialogue
in the above extract, with the
exception of one sentence, is, in the
original, in the same languages in
which we here give it, and that such
polyglot passages are of constant occurrence
throughout these volumes, it
becomes evident that Mr Nolte will
sorely puzzle and tantalise such of
his German readers as are unacquainted
with French, and with that composite
Anglo-Saxon tongue for which
the learned German has declared his
preference over all other modern languages.
The eccentric traveller was
Audubon, the famous ornithologist,
who was also bound for New Orleans.
On reaching Pittsburg, no means of
conveyance offered except Mr Nolte’s
boat, and as he had by this time discovered
that the naturalist was not
only an accomplished draughtsman,
but a good and amiable man, he offered
him a cot in his little cabin, a service
which Audubon afterwards thankfully
recorded and acknowledged in the
third volume of the text to his great
work on “American Ornithology.”
Mr Nolte knew nothing of the object
of his guest’s journey until they reached
Limestone, a small place in the north-western
corner of Ohio State. There
they landed their horses, intending to
visit Lexington, and thence proceed
to Louisville, where Audubon expected
to find his wife—the daughter
of an Englishman named Bakewell.
“At Limestone,” says Mr Nolte,
“we had hardly finished our breakfast,
when Audubon suddenly sprang
up. ‘Now, then,’ he cried to me, in
French, ‘I must begin to lay the foundations
of my establishment!’ Thereupon
he took from his pocket a parcel
of address-cards, a hammer, and some
small nails, and began nailing one of
the cards upon the door of the little
tavern. It contained the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Audubon &#38; Bakewell,</span></div>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='sc'>Commission Merchants.</span></div>
      <div class='line in8'><span class='sc'>Pork, Lard, and Flour.</span></div>
      <div class='line in20'><span class='sc'>New Orleans.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>So, said I to myself, you have found
a rival before reaching your journey’s
end. But I felt little inclination to
deal in the flesh of swine, or apprehensive
of very formidable opposition
from my new acquaintance. We
rode on to Lexington, chief town of
Kentucky, a flourishing place, where
I heard much talk of a certain highly-gifted
lawyer, who, during the elections
for Congress, had distinguished
himself by his pugilistic prowess in
the streets and taverns. This man,
who soon afterwards became more
and more celebrated, was Henry Clay,
whose exterior was no way calculated
to give a high idea of his intellectual
qualities, but who had already acquired
great fame as an orator.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A horrible custom was at that
time almost universal amongst the
inhabitants (for the most part rough
and brutal people) of the Western
States. It was that of allowing the
finger-nails to grow until they could
be cut into the shape of small sickles,
which were used, in the quarrels and
fights that continually occurred, to
scoop out the eyes of an opponent.
This barbarous art was called gouging.
During our ride through Kentucky,
we saw several persons who
wanted an eye, and others who had
lost both. The excitement then prevalent
in the United States on account
of the misunderstanding with England,
was much greater in the western
provinces than on the seaboard,
and the feeling of irritation in the
former was very considerable. Passing
through Frankfort on my way to
Louisville, I learned that the Kentucky
State Legislature was just then
sitting, and I determined to witness its
proceedings, in order to compare it
with the Territorial Legislature of
Louisiana, which was composed of
the strangest mixture of born Americans,
and of French and Spanish
creoles. Hardly had I entered the
hall, when I heard a very animated
orator indulging in a violent diatribe
against England. ‘We must have
war with Great Britain,’ he said.
‘War will ruin her commerce! Commerce
is the apple of Britain’s eye—there
we must <em>gouge</em> her!’ This
flower of rhetoric was prodigiously
applauded, and I could not deny that
for a Kentucky audience it must have
a certain poetical charm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus, sketching by the way a state
of society which a lapse of forty years
has fortunately greatly altered for the
better, Mr Nolte reached Louisville.
The Ohio had been for some days
frozen, and his boats, with his friend
and partner, Hollander, were fast
bound in the ice some distance higher
up the stream. “Three days afterwards,
just as we sat down to dinner,
the whole house was violently shaken;
glasses, plates, and bottles fell from
the table—most of the guests sprang
up, with the cry: ‘There is the earthquake,
by jingo! There is no humbug
about it!’ and ran out into the
street. The commotion was soon
over, and people returned to their
houses. Early next morning I learned
that the shock had broken up the
ice on the river, and that several
boats had come down to Shippingport,
a little town about a league off.”
Among them were Nolte’s craft, and
he continued his journey, presently
quitting the clear transparent stream
of the Ohio, and entering the slimy
waters of the Mississippi. In voyages
of that kind it was customary to
bring-to at nightfall, and make fast
the boats to the shore until next
morning, snags and sawyers rendering
progress unsafe during the darkness.
On the evening of the 6th
February 1812, the halting-place was
hard by the little town of New
Madrid. About twenty boats, which
had left Shippingport together, were
there assembled. “It was a bright
moonlight night,” says Mr Nolte;
“at eleven o’clock my partner, Hollander,
had gone to bed, and I was
sitting at a little table drawing a
caricature of President Madison—who
had just published a flaming proclamation,
calling upon the nation to
‘put on armour and warlike attitude,’
but who was said to be himself completely
under petticoat government—when
a terrible report, like the sudden
roar of cannon, echoed without,
immediately succeeded by innumerable
flashes. The Mississippi foamed
up like the boiling water in a kettle,
and then again receded with a rushing
sound; the trees of a little wood
near to which we had moored our
boats, cracked, broke, and were overthrown.
The terrible spectacle lasted
for several minutes: there seemed no
end to the vivid lightning, to the alternate
rise and fall of the troubled
water, and to the crash of falling
trees. Hollander, startled from his
sleep, called out, ‘What is that,
Nolte?’ I could only tell him that
I myself did not know, but took it for
an earthquake. I went on deck.
What a sight! The river, which had
resumed its ordinary course, was
covered with floating trees and
branches, borne rapidly along by the
current. Of the town, only a few very
distant lights were to be seen. It
was a real chaos. Our little crew consisted
of three sailors, whom want of
employment, in consequence of the
embargo, had driven to Pittsburg, and
of a river-pilot. They told me that
the other boats had all cut loose from
the shore and floated on, and asked
me if we should not do the same.
It struck me that if, under ordinary
circumstances, it was unsafe to proceed
by night, it must be doubly dangerous
now that the river was covered
with floating trees. And so we remained
where we were. The rising
sun showed us the unfortunate city of
New Madrid more than three parts
destroyed, and flooded, with here and
there one of the wretched inhabitants
making his way out of the ruins.
Our boats were in the centre of a sort
of island formed by falling trees, and
several hours passed before we could
extricate ourselves. At Natchez,
which we reached on the thirty-second
day, and where we remained a week,
we heard full particulars of the earthquake,
but we saw nothing of any of
the boats that had surrounded us on
the evening of the 6th February. At
New Orleans, the only sign perceived
of the commotion was a swinging to
and fro of the chandeliers in the ball-room,
and the sickness and fainting
of a great number of ladies. This
remarkable earthquake commenced in
the north-west of Missouri state,
was felt more or less throughout
Louisiana, and extended through the
Gulf of Mexico to Caraccas, where it
played great havoc, destroying nearly
the whole city, and swallowing up or
reducing to poverty forty thousand
persons. Nothing more was ever
heard of the boats, and if we had not
remained stationary we should doubtless
have shared their fate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After five years’ absence, Mr Nolte
found New Orleans greatly increased
in size, but very little improved with
respect to the character of its inhabitants,
who had added to their former
bad qualities a taste for lawsuits and
chicanery, introduced amongst them
by an immigration of greedy advocates
from the Northern States. Mr Nolte—who,
as somebody said of him,
many years later, when he was an
inmate of the Queen’s Bench at the
suit of the litigious and crack-brained
ex-duke of Brunswick, was all his life
the plaything of misfortune, and
whose best concerted and most prudent
plans were invariably marred by
some unforeseen incident or disaster—had
no sooner taken and furnished
a house in the chief city of Louisiana
than news came from Washington of
war having been declared against England—a
crushing blow to our poor
adventurer’s well-founded hopes of
extensive and profitable transactions
with the great European houses who
wished him well and favoured his enterprise.
There was no help for it;
he could but cross his hands and
pray for peace. The Mississippi was
blockaded by British men-of-war.
The state of things at New Orleans
resembled the intolerable monotony
and inactivity of a calm at sea, with
the difference that the latter can last
but a few days or weeks, whilst the
former might endure for years. The
only incidents that varied the monotony
of life at New Orleans during
that war were of an unpleasant nature.
In August 1812, a frightful
hurricane drove on shore eighteen of
the ships in harbour, and unroofed
nearly the whole city. A few months
later, Mr Nolte broke his right arm at
the elbow by a fall from his horse, and
the limb ever afterwards remained
stiff and crooked. Party-spirit ran
high; private scandal, quarrels, and
duels, were resorted to by the restless
and disreputable citizens of New
Orleans as a refuge from ennui. This
portion of Mr Nolte’s book abounds
in curious details. “The whole neighbouring
coast was kept in a state of
alarm by the piracies of the brothers
Laffitte from Bayonne, by Jauvinet,
Beluche, Dominique, Gamba, and
others, who might be seen promenading
the streets of New Orleans in
broad daylight, and wholly unmolested.
They had their friends and
connections and warehouses in the
city, and sold, almost openly, their
stolen goods, especially English manufactures.
But the slave trade was
their great resource. They captured
Spanish and other slavers on the high
seas, and took them to their chief
depôt, the little island of Barataria on
the coast near New Orleans, whither
the planters, chiefly of French extraction,
went to purchase the slaves—for
one hundred and fifty or two hundred
dollars, instead of six hundred or
seven hundred, which they would
have paid in the market—and conveyed
them to their plantations, up
the numerous <em>bayous</em> or creeks intersecting
that district. And as the
pirates would be paid in hard dollars,
specie soon began to be rare in the
city.” Brought into contact, by certain
banking operations, with reckless
and unscrupulous men, Mr Nolte
managed to get involved in a couple
of duels, in which his stiff arm was of
course highly disadvantageous to him,
and, with his usual good luck, he received
a bullet in his leg, which he
still carries about with him. A serious
danger put a temporary end to
these squabbles. An attack was expected
from the English, and General
Jackson made his appearance at New
Orleans with fifteen hundred men,
the most efficient amongst whom were
five hundred riflemen who had served
with Jackson in the Indian war, and
were known as Coffee’s Brigade, from
their commander’s name. These were
the fellows who picked off the British
officers from behind the cotton-bale
barricades, of which the materials
proceeded from Mr Nolte’s stores.
Trained in repeated encounters with
the savages, they were the sort of
men Sealsfield has so vividly painted,
totally ignorant of military organisation
and discipline, but inaccessible to
fear, perfectly cool in danger, of great
presence of mind and personal resource,
and, above all, unerring marksmen.
Mr Nolte, although his stiff
arm exempted him from service, did
not choose to see his friends go out to
fight and himself remain behind—the
less so that he was already suspected
of partiality to the English—and he
joined the light company of a battalion
of militia, several of whose officers
had served under Napoleon. According
to Mr Nolte’s account, Jackson,
blustering, presumptuous, and
overweeningly self-confident, would
have led his militia and irregulars to
certain destruction at the hands of the
well-drilled British troops, but for the
advice given him by Livingston, who
acted as one of his aides-de-camp, to
consult a French emigrant major
named St Gême, who had formerly
been in the English service in Jamaica,
and now commanded a company in
the battalion in which Mr Nolte had
enrolled himself. “This officer had
been a great deal with Moreau, when
the latter, on a visit to Louisiana a
few years previously, had scanned,
with the critical eye of a tactician,
the position of New Orleans and its
capabilities of defence. St Gême
rendered General Jackson and the
American cause the great service of
making him understand that, in the
open field, the English would surround
him and his handful of inexperienced
followers, who had but the
name of soldiers, would utterly rout
and certainly capture them; and he
pointed out to him the M’Carthy
canal as the position which Moreau
had himself fixed upon as the most
defensible, especially for raw troops.”
Mr Nolte, who writes impartially, and
without visible leaning either to English
or to Americans, praises Jackson
for the self-command (a quality he
did not often display) with which he
waived his own wishes in deference to
the opinion of the French general
(he must have been mad to have disregarded
it), and abandoned plans
which assuredly, if carried out, would
have led to the annihilation of his
army and the capture of New Orleans.
Livingston, by whose representations
he was induced to take counsel of the
French major, was a much better
lawyer and statesman than warrior,
according to Mr Nolte, and showed
himself but little where bullets were
flying. When the position decided
upon was to be taken up and redoubts
built, the ground was found to be
swampy and slimy, and the earth unavailable
for any sort of fortification,
whereupon a French engineer suggested
the employment of cotton bales.
The plan adopted, Jackson
would lose no time. “It was observed
to him,” says unlucky Mr
Nolte, lugubriously, “that he certainly
might have plenty of cotton in
the city for six or seven cents a
pound, but its conveyance would
cause a day’s delay, whereas a barque,
already laden with cotton, and whose
departure for the Havana had only
been prevented by the arrival of the
English squadron, lay close to the
shore. It had on board two hundred
and forty-five bales, which I myself
had shipped just before the invasion,
and sixty others belonging to a Spaniard
of New Orleans. I was ill-pleased,
when they could have had
cheap cotton for six or seven cents in
the town, to see them land, from a
ship all ready to sail, my best quality,
which had cost me ten or eleven cents,
and I said as much to Livingston,
who was my usual legal adviser in
New Orleans, and whom I fell in with
at Battery No. 3. He was never at
a loss for an answer. ‘Well, Nolte,’
said he, ‘since it is your cotton, you
will not mind the trouble of defending
it.’ A reply which was the foundation
of the story that, when the
owner of the cotton complained of its
seizure, Jackson sent him a musket,
with the message that upon no man
was it so incumbent to defend the
bales as upon their owner, and that
he therefore hoped he would not
abandon them.” Mr Nolte’s whole
account of the operations at New Orleans
is clear and graphic, but that
brief campaign has been so often
described that we are not induced to
dwell at much length upon his narrative,
although it contains some passages
that, proceeding from an actor
on the American side, possess particular
interest. On the left wing were
the best sharpshooters of Kentucky
and Tennessee, invisible in the cypress
wood, and loading their rifles with
three or four buckshot besides the
bullet. Their good weapons and sure
aim sent destruction through the ranks
of the English, who saw no foe, but
beheld all their officers picked off.
The whole right flank of the English
column was raked by this deadly fire,
whilst in front the American batteries
kept up an uninterrupted discharge.
“From time to time,” says Mr Nolte,
“when the smoke blew aside, I and
my company obtained a view over
the battle-field, and there we saw
the whole English centre retreating,
throwing away their fascines, and a
staff-officer on a black horse gallop
forward, his hat in his hand, which
he angrily waved as if threatening the
flying column. Suddenly, struck by
several bullets, he fell backwards
from his horse—some soldiers wrapped
him hastily in blankets and carried
him off. We learned in the evening
that the staff-officer was the commander-in-chief,
General Pakenham.”
The fight was soon over. As Mr Nolte
justly observes, it was a butchery
rather than a battle. The Americans,
completely sheltered, had but some
thirty men killed and wounded, whilst
their opponents had to deplore the
loss of many hundred good soldiers,
than whom none braver ever bore
muskets, but whose commander’s
good fortune was, upon that occasion,
unfortunately not equal to his
often-tried valour, and who, moreover,
was misled by false information.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Nolte does ample justice to
the coolness, energy, and resolution
of General Jackson, and shows
that even the gasconades and exaggerations
in which he constantly indulged
had their use, since he thereby
deluded his own people, and all the
prisoners taken by the English concurred
in such formidable accounts of
the forces at his disposal as could not
fail to influence the proceedings of
the invaders. But after the affair of
the 8th January, Jackson, prodigiously
elevated by his triumph, was
anxious to assume the offensive. For
the second time he was indebted to
Livingston for sound advice. “What
would you have more?” said the lawyer;
“the city is saved; the English
will not renew the attack. Against
troops like those, whose intrepidity
amidst the most frightful slaughter
you yourself have witnessed, what is
the use of exposing yourself and your
handful of men to be roughly handled,
to the diminution of your glory and
at risk of valuable lives?” As in the
case of the position, the general took
his aide-de-camp’s sensible advice,
and, as is not unusual, got the whole
credit of adopting the only rational
course. Livingston, some of whose
eulogists have made of him a hero as
well as a lawgiver, was seized, it
appears from Mr Nolte’s version of
the campaign, with a bad colic on the
evening of the 7th, just after it became
known that the English would
attack next morning, and retired into
New Orleans, where he next day
received news of the action. An hour
afterwards he was back in camp—the
English and the colic having retreated
together. Another of Jackson’s
volunteer aides-de-camp, also
a lawyer, was off into the city before
daybreak on the 8th, without
even a pretext, and passed the morning
riding about the streets, shouting
out that the foe was at hand, and calling
upon all to arm and hasten to the
field—whereas all capable of bearing
arms were in the field, except a few
skulkers like himself. No notice was
taken of these gentlemen’s shy behaviour,
and Jackson, in his despatch,
drawn up by Livingston, thanked
his military and voluntary aides-de-camp
“for their cool and deliberate
bravery!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The cotton bales used for the redoubts,
and a quantity of blankets
that had been taken from Mr Nolte’s
warehouse during his absence from
the city, gave rise to discussions which
brought out the least favourable side
of Jackson’s character. Immediately
after the embarkation of the English,
a commission was appointed to settle
all claims. Mr Nolte’s was for 750
blankets and 245 bales of cotton. The
former he was allowed for at the
price of the day on which the English
landed—namely, eleven dollars a-pair;
but when the order was submitted to
Jackson for his signature and ratification,
he said that as the blankets had
been taken (almost forcibly) by the
Tennessee riflemen, they should be
paid for in Tennessee notes—then
worth 10 per cent less than New Orleans
paper-money. Mr Nolte was
fain to submit to this shabby trick,
worthy of a Connecticut pedlar. As
regarded his cotton he had much more
trouble. He produced the invoice,
proving that he had bought it, two years
previously, at 10 cents a pound, from
a well-known wealthy cotton-grower.
He claimed that price, with the addition
of two years’ interest. During
the whole of that time, it had never
been lower than 10 to 11 cents a
pound, and a few days before the landing
of the English he had bought some
at 12½ cents. But when the British
troops were on shore, and close at
hand, there was a panic; markets fell,
the timid realised at any price, and a
small parcel of cotton of the same
quality was sold at 7 cents. When
Mr Nolte’s claim was submitted to
Jackson, he allowed it, and said the
cotton must be paid for at the price
it would have fetched upon the day
the American troops marched out of
the town. No notice being taken of
Mr Nolte’s written protest against
such manifest injustice, he went to
Jackson, then in all the intoxication
of his triumph, and of the exaggerated
homage paid him by his countrymen,
and very well disposed to exert the
arbitrary power given him by the
military law he still quite unnecessarily
maintained—a stretch of authority
for which it will be remembered
that he was afterwards fined by
the civil tribunals. In reply to Mr
Nolte’s representation and remonstrance—</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Aren’t you very lucky,’ he asked,
‘to have saved the rest of your cotton
through my defence of the city?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Certainly, general,’ answered I,
‘as lucky as every other man in the
place, but with this difference, that it
costs them nothing, and that I have
to bear all the loss.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Loss?’ cried the general, getting
rather angry—‘loss? You have saved
everything!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw it was no use arguing with
such an obstinate man, and remarked
to him that I only wanted compensation
for my cotton, nothing more, and
that the best compensation would be
to give me back the same quantity
and quality that had been taken from
me; that I would appoint one merchant,
he another; they would agree
as to quality, buy the cotton, deliver
it me, and he should pay for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘No, no, sir!’ replied Jackson;
‘I like straightforward business, and
that is too complicated. You must
take 6 cents for your cotton. I have
nothing more to say.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wanted to make the whole thing
clear to him, but he cut me short:
‘Come, sir, come! Take a glass of
whiskey-and-water; you must be
damned dry after all your arguing.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“All I could do was to say: ‘Well,
general, I did not expect such injustice
at your hands! Good morning,
sir!’ And I went away. Three
days afterwards news came of the
conclusion of peace, and the consequence
was an immediate rise of cotton
to 16 cents, at which price I
bought several parcels. The committee
of claims were embarrassed;
they felt that it was now impossible
to fob me off with 6 cents. At last I
was asked if I would <em>now</em> be content
with payment of my invoice; and I
agreed to be so, since I must else have
complained to Congress, and the affair
might have dragged on for years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Some pages are devoted by Mr
Nolte to an appreciation of Old
Hickory’s character. He condemns
his arbitrary and overbearing disposition,
and his cruelty to the unfortunate
Indians, whom he so implacably
and perseveringly hunted down,
but does justice to his shrewdness
and other good qualities, considering,
however, that good luck had more to
do than commanding talent with the
distinction and popularity he attained
to in the States—an opinion which
we suspect to be now entertained by
a very large number of Jackson’s
countrymen. Of the general’s tone
and manners—rough as those of a far-west
woodsman—Mr Nolte gives some
humorous examples. After the action
in front of New Orleans, demonstrations
innumerable were made in
the hero’s honour. On his return
into the city, Mrs Livingston placed
a crown of laurel upon his head,
which seemed considerably to embarrass
the slayer of Seminoles, who
took it off as if it burned his brow;
the ladies subscribed for a costly set
of jewels for Mrs General Jackson;
and the principal inhabitants got up
a grand ball in the French Exchange.
Mr Nolte, who had seen more public
festivities than most of the people of
New Orleans, was a prominent and
active member of the committee.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The upper part of the Exchange
was arranged for dancing, the lower
part for supper, with flowers, coloured
lamps, and transparencies. Before
supper, Jackson desired to go alone
and take a view of the arrangements,
and I had to show him the way. On
one of the transparencies, between the
arcades, were to be read the words:
‘Jackson and victory, they are but
one.’ The general turned round to
me, in a more cordial manner than
I might have expected, and asked,
‘Why did you not say Hickory and
victory, they are but one?’ After
supper the hero of the day gave us the
diverting spectacle of a <em>pas de deux</em> between
him and his wife—an Irish emigrant
of low origin and considerable
corpulence, whom he had taken away
from a planter in Georgia. To see
those two, the general a long lean
man with skeleton-like limbs, and his
wife, a short thick specimen of the
female figure, dancing opposite to
each other like half-drunken Indians,
to the wild tune of ‘Opossum up
a gum tree,’ was truly one of those
remarkable spectacles which would
be sought in vain in any European
ballet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>During the second year of the war
between England and the States, a
fine West Indiaman of 900 tons burthen,
the “Lord Nelson,” was captured
by the Yankee privateer Saratoga,
taken into New Orleans, and
sold by auction for a fourth of its
value. Mr Nolte was the purchaser.
Now that the war was over, he loaded
her with cotton and deerskins, altered
her name to the “Horatio,” and sailed
for Nantes, with several passengers
on board. The ship was but just
outside the mouths of the Mississippi,
when she spoke a vessel that had
made an unusually short voyage from
Havre, and brought news of Napoleon’s
landing at Cannes, rapid march
through France, and reinstallation in
the Tuileries. Two Frenchmen, who
were amongst the passengers, and
one of whom had served under the
emperor, were overjoyed. Presently
it was discovered that the “Horatio”
had not enough ballast for her two
thousand bales of cotton, and she put
into the Havana to supply the deficiency,
thus somewhat lengthening
her voyage. Off the Scilly Islands
she spoke the monthly packet from
London to New York. After the
interchange of a little nautical information:
“What news from France?”
roared Mr Nolte’s captain through
his speaking-trumpet. “The Duke
of Wellington and the British army
are in Paris,” was the reply. “Where
is Buonaparte?” “Fled—nobody
knows where.” And the two ships
pursued their respective courses. The
French passengers would not believe a
word of it. It was English news, they
said, manufactured in London; and
they proved to each other, as clear as
sunlight, that it was physically and
morally impossible the intelligence
should be true. It took the testimony
of a French pilot, and the sight of the
white flag on the banks of the Loire,
to convince them that Napoleon had
again fallen. The French population
of New Orleans went yet farther in
their incredulity. The Buonapartist
<cite><span lang="fr">Courrier de la Louisiane</span></cite> analysed the
news, and ingeniously proved that
the pretended victory of the Allies
was merely a mask for a total defeat;
that the emperor had achieved one of
his great triumphs, which should forthwith
be celebrated. And accordingly
Napoleon’s bust, crowned with laurels,
was that evening carried in procession,
by the light of hundreds of
torches, with several bands of music
playing French national airs;—premature
rejoicings, which the confirmation
of the defeat of the French
converted into profound consternation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Paris, whither Mr Nolte hastened
as soon as possible after landing, was
full of novelty and excitement, and
the focus on which the eyes of Europe
were fixed. He devotes an interesting
chapter to sketches of “Paris after
Waterloo.” Amongst the crowds of
foreign uniforms were here and there to
be seen, he says, “spectral figures, in
long blue coats buttoned to the chin,
spurred boots, and hats pressed down
over their eyes. These men, who
cast such gloomy glances around them,
were the officers of the disbanded
French army. The ribbon of the
Legion of Honour had disappeared
from their button-hole, but it was
easy to recognise them by their flashing
eyes and fierce expression when
an English uniform drew near. An
accidental push or touch on the foot,
often unavoidable in a crowd, and
they would burst out, in great bitterness,
with an angry—‘<i><span lang="fr">Je suis Français,
Monsieur!</span></i>’ or, ‘<i><span lang="fr">No, Padrone,
questa e l’uniforme di Amburgo!</span></i>’ and if the ‘<i><span lang="fr">Pardon, Monsieur!</span></i>’
was not forthcoming, a quarrel
was the almost inevitable result.
The police had the difficult task of
keeping these remnants of the French
army out of Paris, but they were not
very successful in so doing. Notwithstanding
the violent irritation of
the French military, which was kept
under only by the strong hand, nobody
in Paris went amongst them more
fearlessly than the Duke of Wellington,
who showed himself everywhere
in a plain blue frock, with the English
red scarf round his waist, and a simple
red and white feather in his cocked
hat, and usually rode about alone,
followed only by a sergeant. Thus
plainly equipped and slenderly escorted,
I saw him one morning ride into
the court of the Hotel de l’Empire,
and ask for the celebrated London
banker Angerstein, who was stopping
there.” Ney’s death, the restaurants
and coffeehouses then in vogue, and
which were thronged with English
and Prussian officers, and grand reviews
of the allied troops, are in turn
glanced at. At the review of the
Russian guard, drawn up along the
whole length of the boulevards, Mr
Nolte had a particularly good view
of the sovereigns. By favour of a
colonel, with whom he had fallen into
conversation, he was allowed to remain
within the line cleared by the
sentries, and close to the colonel’s
horse. “Suddenly the three monarchs
came riding rapidly up, the Emperor
Alexander in the middle, his eyes
directed to the ladies in the balconies
and at the windows—on his right
the Emperor Francis, with a serious
straightforward gaze—on his left
King Frederick-William III., who
seemed to be examining the grisettes
in the crowd rather than the ladies at
the windows. The staff, according
to the estimate of my obliging colonel,
comprised more than a thousand military
men of all nations. As good
luck would have it, the sovereigns
and their whole retinue paused in
front of the regiment on my right,
and the colonel pointed out to me the
Russian grand-dukes, the Austrian
archdukes, several Prussian princes,
Wellington, Schwarzenberg, Blucher,
Platoff,” &#38;c. &#38;c. Of all the commanders
then assembled in Paris, the
most dissatisfied was the American
general, Scott (since noted for his
campaign in Mexico), who had been
opposed to the English on the Canadian
frontier, had taken a fort or two,
and was looked upon by his countrymen
as a military star of the very
first magnitude—second only to Jackson,
and equal to any other warrior
then extant. He had been sent to
Europe to increase his military knowledge
and study the art of war, and
reached Paris fully convinced that all
the great chiefs of the Continental
armies would hasten to greet and
compliment him. “To his visible
vexation, he found himself completely
mistaken. In the great military
meetings in the French capital, where
Wellington, Blucher, Schwarzenberg,
Kutusoff, Woronzoff, and a host of
other celebrities, laden with stars and
orders, were assembled—the long thin
man, in his blue coat without embroidery,
and with only a pair of
moderate-sized epaulets, excited no
attention. Scott could not get over
the contrast between the figure he
had so recently cut in his native land,
and the insignificance he was condemned
to in France, and he often
exhibited bitter and somewhat laughable
ill-humour.” After a visit to the
field of Waterloo, Mr Nolte returns
to America, on cotton speculations
intent—of which, and of Baring
Brothers, he for some time discourses,
until we are not sorry to see the
theme changed, and him back in Paris,
passing a Sunday at the country-house
of <i><span lang="fr">Maison sur Seine</span></i>, built by Louis
XIV., and then just purchased from
the French government by the banker
Jacques Laffitte, whom he found in
his park, accompanied by two plainly-dressed
and plain-mannered Englishmen,
who talked knowingly about
cotton, and whom he took for Manchester
cotton-spinners. At dinner,
to his surprise, although Casimir
Perrier and several deputies and
Frenchmen of mark were present, the
places of honour were for the Englishmen.
He made up his mind that
they must be very great people in the
cotton-spinning line—perhaps the
first in Manchester—and that they
must have large credits on Laffitte’s
house—that giving, not unfrequently,
the measure of the hospitality of Parisian
bankers. Laffitte, who was a
great talker—given to discourse for
hours together, with scarcely a break,
and with innumerable digressions totally
irrelevant to the subject under
discussion—was loquacious as usual,
and related many things that had occurred
during the Hundred Days.
At that time Napoleon had sent for
and consulted him almost daily. Laffitte
said that he had never been a
worshipper of Napoleon’s, but he then
had opportunity of convincing himself
that the emperor possessed, in the
highest degree, the art of popularity.
“‘He was very confidential with me,’
said Laffitte, ‘spoke without reserve,
and once made a striking remark
concerning our nation. “To govern
the French,” he said, “one must have
arms of iron and gloves of velvet.”’
My readers may probably have heard
this remark, but not the reply immediately
made by Madame Laffitte’s
right-hand neighbour (one of the
Manchester cotton-spinners aforesaid).
‘Yes,’ he said, ‘that is very
true, but—he often forgot to put on
his gloves.’ The remark was so apt
and true that all present laughed
heartily. I asked my next neighbour
who the witty foreigner was, and
learned that it was the Marquis of
Lansdowne.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Involved in the commercial disasters
of 1825–6, Mr Nolte left New
Orleans, sixteen years after his first
establishment there, and went to seek
in Europe that fortune which had
constantly eluded his grasp in the
States. His success in the Old World
was little better than in the New. In
after years, he again more than once
visited America, and engaged in enormous
cotton speculations, in which
he burnt his fingers. Cotton seems
to have had for him the same irresistible
attraction that dice have for the
veteran gambler. Although many of
his misfortunes were the result of circumstances
neither to be foreseen nor
guarded against, and although we
may suppose that he makes out the
best case he fairly can, the impression
left by his book upon the reader’s
mind is, that Mr Vincent Nolte has
been, to say the least, a very venturesome
person, and that his abilities
and opportunities would have amply
sufficed to insure him ultimate affluence,
had he been less impatient to
acquire a large and rapid fortune. On
the other hand, he deserves credit for
his unflinching pluck, and for his elasticity
under misfortune. When he
left New Orleans, he attempted to
form a partnership at Havre, but in
vain; and he himself frankly admits
that he was unsuccessful, because the
merchants with whom he would have
associated himself were deterred by
his reputed taste for the vast and daring
operations in which he had been
early initiated. The slow but sure
gains of the steady trader he never
had patience to collect; the ordinary
routine of commercial affairs was to
him wearisome and intolerable; he
carried into the peaceful paths of trade
something of that venturesome and
aspiring spirit which, upon the battle-field,
insures the soldier high distinction
or sudden death—a bullet or a
marshal’s baton. We regret to fear
that it has led Mr Nolte, after his long
and busy life, to no very prosperous
position; although he seems to preserve
to the last the spirit and vigour
that have borne him through so many
trying vicissitudes. At the time now
referred to, he was still in his prime,
and full of hope and confidence.
From Havre he betook himself to his
favourite city of Paris, where, by the
assistance and introduction of his
staunch friends the Barings, he was
on the eve of concluding a partnership
for the establishment of a house
at Marseilles. The circulars were
printed; Mr Nolte took a run to
Hamburg, Holland, and England, to
visit commercial friends, and everywhere
he met a kind and encouraging
reception. He reached Southampton,
on his return to Paris, two hours after
the departure of the packet, and, with
characteristic impatience, rather than
wait two days, hired an open boat,
whose owner undertook to land him
at Havre early the next morning. It
was a moonlight night, and a fair
wind at starting, but he was becalmed
in the Channel, and lay a whole
day roasting in the sun. Upon the
morning of the 26th July 1830, he
landed at Havre, and posted on to
Paris. At Rouen he remarked signs
of uneasiness, and the troops were
under arms; at Courbevoie he received
the first news of the fatal ordinances;
outside the Paris barrier, a
few persons stopped his chaise, and
tore the white cockade from the postilion’s
hat. Paris was enacting the
most peaceful and respectable of its
numerous revolutions.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Nolte witnessed the proceedings
of the three days of July, and betook
himself to Marseilles, where he had
scarcely commenced business when
the failure of the Irish-French bankers
who were to advance the greater part
of the capital on behalf of his partner
compelled him again to abandon it,
and once more to return to Paris. He
had been on very intimate terms with
General Lafayette during that veteran
revolutionist’s visit to the United
States in 1825, had travelled with
him, acted as his banker, rendered
him some service, and shown him
many attentions; for which he deemed
himself far more than compensated
by the privilege of the general’s society,
and by the interest of his conversation.
Alone with him, in the
cabin of the American steamer which
the authorities of New Orleans had
allotted to the use of Washington’s
old friend and comrade, Lafayette
spoke freely of his past life and present
opinions, and Mr Nolte was astonished
by the revelation of plans
which he would never have suspected
to have lingered in that venerable
head—so soon, in all probability, to
be laid in the grave. The man who,
at least as well as any living, had had
opportunities of judging the Bourbon
character—before and since the day
when, upon the balcony at Versailles,
he kissed, in sign of peace and good
understanding, the hand of the defamed
and martyred Marie Antoinette,
amidst the acclamations of assembled
thousands, whose discontent the symbol
and the promised return of the
royal family to Paris promptly, although
but temporarily, appeased—declared
his conviction of its unworthiness.
For the good of France, in
his opinion, she must expel the race
of whom Talleyrand so truly said,
that they had forgotten nothing, and
learned nothing. “‘France cannot
be happy under the Bourbons,’ said
Lafayette, ‘and we must get rid of
them. It would be already done, had
Laffitte chosen.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Indeed!’ I exclaimed; ‘how so?’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘It is not so long ago,’ continued
the general, ‘that you will have forgotten
how two of the regiments of
guards that were ordered to Spain
under the command of the Duke of
Angoulême, halted in Toulouse, and
showed signs of raising the banner of
revolt. The affair was quickly suppressed,
and kept as quiet as possible.
But the plan was ripe! I knew that
from my private correspondence with
several officers, and nothing but money
was wanting for a successful insurrection
then to have occurred. I addressed
myself to Laffitte; he had
scruples; he would and he would not.
At last I offered to carry the thing
through without his participation. On
the first occasion when we are alone
together—I said to him—but as soon
as possible, lay a million of francs in
bank-notes upon the chimney-piece—I
will put them in my pocket without
your perceiving it. The rest you may
leave to me! Laffitte hesitated, was
undecided, and at last declared he
would have nothing whatever to do
with the affair. And so the whole
project fell through!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I could not conceal my surprise.
‘Had I heard what you have just told
me from any other lips than yours,
general,’ I said, ‘I would not have
believed a word of it.’ The general
merely replied, ‘<em><span lang="fr">C’etait pourtant
ainsi</span>.</em>’”</p>

<p class='c010'>In 1830 Lafayette’s desire was fulfilled—not
to its full extent, for he
wished the Bourbons to be replaced
by a republic, partly because he believed
that form of government the
best suited to render France happy
and prosperous, and partly because
it would have best enabled him to
gratify his unbounded greed of popularity.
But the Bourbons had fled,
and France had a citizen king and a
national guard. Arms were required
for the latter, and Mr Nolte thought
that their supply would be a profitable
business—quite in his way, because
there was much money to be made in
a short time. Lafayette, besides being
commander-in-chief of the national
guard, was the intimate friend of
Gerard, Louis Philippe’s first minister
of war, in whose department the
matter lay, and who was desirous of
making contracts for the supply of
muskets. Mr Nolte betook himself
to Lafayette, who received him most
cordially (embracing him, to the infinite
astonishment of his aide-de-camp,
who had taken Nolte for an Englishman),
and gave him the strongest
recommendation to Gerard; the result
of which was, that he obtained
extensive contracts for the supply not
only of muskets, but of the <em>briquets</em> or
short Roman swords which Soult, who
succeeded Gerard at the war-office,
introduced into the army, and by
which the mercenary old marshal—so
his enemies affirmed, and thousands
to this day believe—himself pocketed
no inconsiderable sum. Be this true
or not—and Soult’s proved rapacity
at many previous periods of his life
gave but too much probability to the
accusation—Mr Nolte had occasion,
whilst carrying out his contracts,
which extended over a considerable
time, to note several instances of that
venality of French officials which rose
to such a height under Louis Philippe’s
reign as at last to extend to his very
ministers, and to constitute one of the
prominent causes of his dethronement.
As early as 1831, Mr Nolte assures
us, itching palms were plenty in
France, and that amongst personages
of no humble rank. But as far as
military men were concerned, this
was a mere continuation of the traditions
and usages of the Empire—that
period of unrefined sensuality and
reckless extravagance, during which
Napoleon’s subalterns, following their
leader’s unscrupulous example, filled
their pockets whenever and wherever
they could, without much regard to
the delicacy of the means employed.
Amongst the anecdotes illustrative of
this state of corruption to be found
in Mr Nolte’s Reminiscences, is one
of a certain general officer, not named,
whom he thought it advisable to propitiate
by a present. In this case, as
in all others of the kind in which he
had to deal with men of good breeding
and position, the puzzle was how
to administer the <em>douceur</em> so that it
might be taken without embarrassment.
Mrs Nolte, to whom her husband
communicated his difficulty, undertook
to ascertain, through her
acquaintances, the tastes and partialities
of the high functionary in
question. She discovered that he was
very fond of snuff-boxes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This ascertained,” says Mr Nolte,
“I chose a very handsome box, and
placed a bank-note in it, in such a
manner that on opening the box the
amount, 1000 francs, must immediately
catch the eye. Then I took
the first opportunity that presented
itself, when my friend had recourse
to his own box for a pinch, to produce
mine, as if for the same purpose.
It immediately attracted his attention.
‘That snuff-box is really in
excellent taste!’ he exclaimed. ‘Since
it pleases you, general,’ I replied,
‘oblige me by accepting it as a keepsake!’
He thanked me, took the box,
and at once opened it. I did not long
remain in doubt as to the manner in
which my present would be received.
‘Aha!’ he cried, ‘but it is right you
should know that I am a great snuff-taker.
A double pinch never does
any harm, my dear sir!’ and so saying,
he pocketed the box. The hint
sufficed. On my return home, I enclosed
a second thousand-franc note,
with my card, in an envelope, and
sent it to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Another officer of rank, a colonel of
artillery, who had served under Napoleon,
and was then in command of
the arsenal at Havre, made some
difficulty about receiving a much
larger sum, offered him by Mr Nolte
in acknowledgment of important and
gratuitous services, most kindly rendered.
He ended by pocketing the
affront, when it was sent by Mr Nolte
under cover to his confidential servant,
and probably, as an old soldier
of the Empire, he thought it quite equitable
and honourable that he should
have his slice of the contractor’s gain.
But he afterwards made a most generous
use of a portion of the sum. Poor
Nolte, after toiling hard for three
years, during which time he delivered
arms to the amount of nearly eight
millions of francs, fell amongst thieves,
as too often happened to him, and
was swindled out of all his earnings.
Some time afterwards, when he was
absent from Paris in pursuit of fresh
schemes, Colonel Lefrançois happened
to hear that his wife was in embarrassed
circumstances, and immediately
called upon her. “My dear
Madam,” he said, “I have received
a great deal of money from your husband,
much more than I had any
claim to—I have spent and squandered
the greater part of it, as one is
wont to do with windfalls of that
kind. But now that you need it, it
is my duty to return you what remains.
Here it is—do me the favour
to accept it. You, your husband, and
your little family, will always be dear
to me.” This trait contrasts pleasingly
with the numerous others, of a very
contrary nature, to be found in the
record of Mr Nolte’s Parisian experiences
and transactions. These were
of a nature to bring him into unavoidable—but,
to him, in no way discreditable—connection
with various equivocal
characters. Some of his contracts
were for secondhand muskets, which he
employed agents to seek in the brokers’
shops of Paris. Many of these agents
were recommended to him by the
subordinate officials of the war-office.
Others he fell in with casually. Thus,
in the month of December 1831, a
down-looking man, of unprepossessing
exterior, accosted him on the stairs of
the artillery depot, in the Rue de
Luxembourg, and offered his services
for the purchase of old muskets. Mr
Nolte briefly replied, that if he knew
of a parcel of such weapons for sale,
he would send to look at them, and
would buy them if price and quality
suited.  Accordingly, several small
parcels of arms were purchased of this
man, whose name was Darmenon, and
whose flighty, uncertain manner always
displeased Mr Nolte, and made
him think he must have done something
that would not bear daylight.
On inquiry of the police, he learned
that he was a forger, who had served
his time at the galleys. He could
not, however, on this account, make
up his mind to refuse the unfortunate
fellow’s services, and so, perhaps,
drive him again to crime, so he continued
to employ him, and Darmenon
made himself very useful, and, moreover,
gave him constant information
of the plans and movements of the
malcontents of the Faubourg St Antoine.
Through him and other agents,
Mr Nolte was kept informed of the
number of muskets daily brought into
Paris, the persons to whom they were
delivered, and various other particulars.
It was rare that more than 100
or 120 came in at a time.  One
morning, however, Darmenon informed
his employer that 2600 had been
brought in at an early hour through
the barrier of St Denis, and had been
taken to the faubourg of the same
name. On reporting this at the ministry
of war, Mr Nolte received
directions to purchase the whole lot
immediately on government account,
and regardless of price. The purchase
was effected, but not without some
competition, which he thought unlikely
to proceed from a merely
mercantile motive, and on setting his
agents to work, he found that his
competitors were the Legitimists, who
had been very busy for some time
past. He became convinced, from
this and other information that reached
him, that there was a plot in existence
against Louis Philippe, and he desired
Darmenon to keep a sharp look-out,
and inform him of whatever came
to his knowledge. The occupation
seemed to the taste of the ex-galley-slave,
who reported, on the morning
of the 1st February, that several
Carlist emissaries were at work in the
Faubourg St Antoine, that towards
noon there would probably be a
gathering of workmen, who would
raise the banner of Henry V., and
that at ten o’clock at night the conspirators
would leave the house, No.
18 Rue des Prouvaires, force their
way into the Tuileries, where there
was to be a ball that evening, surround
Louis Philippe, lead him away, and
put him to death. The conspirators,
with whom Darmenon confessed himself
to have been long in the habit of
intercourse, had offered him 6000
francs for 200 muskets, and had paid
him 2000 francs in advance. These
circumstantial details, and the sight
of the notes, convincing Mr Nolte of
the truth of the story, he jumped into
his cab and drove to the prefecture of
police, then presided over by the
notorious Gisquet. On his way he
called at the Bourse. There had been
a sudden fall of 1½ per cent, owing to
alarming rumours and to heavy sales
by the Carlists. Gisquet, with whom
Mr Nolte was acquainted, discredited,
or affected to discredit, the whole
affair, but noted a few particulars, and
politely thanked his informant for the
needless trouble he had given himself.
But, before seven o’clock that evening,
Darmenon had the whole 6000 francs
in his possession. The 200 muskets
were to be sent for before ten o’clock.
Mr Nolte again hurried to Gisquet,
and asked if he should deliver them.
“Yes,” was the reply; “a few at a
time; I will have them followed.”
Mr Nolte gave the needful instructions,
and was informed, the next morning,
by his storekeeper, that Darmenon had
had seventeen muskets delivered to
him, and had been forthwith arrested.
The Paris papers of the 2d February
announced that the police, with Mr
Carlier (then chief of the municipal
guard, since prefect of police under
the Republic) at their head, had
forced their way into the house, No.
18 Rue des Prouvaires, at 11 o’clock
on the previous night, and, after some
resistance, had captured the whole
band of conspirators there assembled.
From the evidence on the trial, it
appeared that Gisquet, incredulous to
the eleventh hour, was even then undecided
what to do. He feared the
attack of the opposition press, ever
ready to accuse the police of fabricating
the plots they discovered. Carlier
at last put an end to his perplexity,
by violently exclaiming, “They are
armed; we are of superior force; we
must enter the house and use our
weapons!” An hour later this was
done; a municipal guard was killed,
and Carlier himself received a slight
bullet-wound on the head.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Marshal Soult, Mr Nolte
tells us, learned that it was one of his
contractors who had led the way to
the discovery of the plot, he was displeased
that he had not been first
informed of it, instead of the prefect
of police. He was jealous of Thiers,
then minister of the interior, who, on
his part, bore him no love. Soult
would not have been sorry to expose
the inefficiency of his colleague’s police;
Thiers, owing to the course adopted
by Mr Nolte, was enabled to make a
boast of its vigilance. All the merit
of the affair was attributed to Gisquet,
who was promoted to the rank of
officer of the Legion of Honour. And
when that worthy, after he was dismissed
for his venality and scandalous
immorality, wrote his memoirs and
attempted justification, he ascribed
the discovery of the plot of the Rue
des Prouvaires entirely to his own
activity and zeal, and made no mention
whatever of Mr Nolte.</p>

<p class='c010'>A chapter of amusing gossip, headed
“Reminiscences of the Artistic World
of Paris,” tempts us to linger, but the
length to which this paper has already
extended admonishes us to pause.
We conclude by extracting a short
anecdote, which we do not remember
to have before heard, of that eccentric
genius, Horace Vernet. It was some
time before the capture of the Smala,
his picture of which added so greatly
to his reputation. Vernet was in
Marshal Bugeaud’s camp, where all
the soldiers knew of his presence, and
one of them, who had promised to
send his portrait to his mother, went
to him and asked him if he would
undertake the work, and at what
price. Vernet’s reply was that he
could not do it for less than a twenty-franc
piece. The soldier thought this
rather a high figure, but agreed to pay
it, provided the likeness was perfect.
This the painter promised that it
should be, and accordingly, when the
picture was done, it was exhibited
in the camp, and the striking resemblance
was proclaimed by all the
comrades of the original. Thereupon
the soldier paid the stipulated price,
which Vernet quietly pocketed, observing
that an artist must live by
the price of his work. On leaving
the camp, two days afterwards, he
sent twenty napoleons to the captain
of the soldier’s company, for
distribution to him and his brave comrades.</p>

<p class='c010'>Seldom, either in print or in the
flesh, have we fallen in with so restless,
versatile, and excursive a genius
as Vincent Nolte, Esq., of Europe and
America—no more limited address
will sufficiently express his cosmopolitan
domicile. The reader will perhaps
imagine, after the perusal of this
tolerably desultory paper, that we
have traced a considerable portion of
his journey through life. No idea
was ever more erroneous. We have
only picked a little here and there,
and have taken scarcely any notice of
the parts the author doubtless considers
the most important in his book,
and which will certainly be read with
strong interest by bankers and merchants
old enough to remember the
mercantile history of the first quarter
of the present century. It is chiefly
to those intimate and personal commercial
details that we attribute the
uncommon success Mr Nolte’s autobiography
has had in its place of
publication, and in Germany generally.
Independently of those, it contains
matter of interest and entertainment
for all classes of readers.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c002'>A SPORTING SETTLER IN CEYLON.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c008'><sup>[12]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One of the most striking features
of the present age, with reference to
our own country, is to be found in
that wonderful chain of steam communication,
which within the last few
years we have seen gradually linking
together the British dominions, and
which must girdle the globe before it
completely connects every portion of
our vast empire. But if it is a subject
of national pride that our possessions
are scattered so widely over the
face of the earth, the universal ignorance
which prevails respecting them
in the mother country only becomes
the more incomprehensible and deeply
to be deplored. Moreover, the comparatively
small amount of intelligence
which has been brought to bear
upon the subject has been most partially
and improperly distributed. The
<em>colonies</em> of Great Britain have engrossed
all the sympathies of the home
public. The <em>dependencies</em> are utterly
neglected, or, which comes to much
the same thing, consigned unreservedly
to the tender mercies of the Colonial
Office.</p>

<p class='c010'>However much may be regretted
this marked preference in favour of
the colony, it is easily accounted for.
An inviting and almost totally uninhabited
country of vast extent and
genial climate, possessing a fertile
soil, and sources of unknown wealth,
tempts a certain class of the home
community to quit for ever their native
shores and risk their fortunes in those
distant lands, which henceforward
possess an interest in the eyes of those
they have left behind, and create in
them the spirit of inquiry and enterprise.
In the case of the dependency,
no such inducement exists. A tropical
climate is a bugbear utterly appalling
to the intending emigrant. He
shudders at the bare idea of passing
the rest of his existence in a temperature
of 90°, exposed to the attacks
of cholera, fever, natives, and snakes.
He has heard of fortunes having been
made in India, but he has never heard
of children having been brought up
there, and so having failed in the
attempt to get a writership for his
son, he pities the lot of those who are
more successful, does not bestow a
second thought upon that continent to
which his country owes, in a great
measure, her prosperity, and betakes
himself, with his wife and family, to
the backwoods of Canada.</p>

<p class='c010'>And if India is treated with such
indifference, what must be the fate of
that large pear-shaped island at its
southern extremity, perhaps more
easily recognised by the well educated
as Taprobane than as Ceylon. To
be sure, Trincomalee (the white man’s
grave) is a name familiar to their
ears, but the existence of Colombo, a
city containing 60,000 inhabitants,
and the seat of government, is altogether
ignored, just as the Cingalese
themselves seldom hear of England,
or are accustomed to think of it only
as the capital of London. The absence
of any recent popular work
upon Ceylon may in some measure
account for, while it cannot quite excuse,
this ignorance. And we should
certainly deeply commiserate any one
who, in a moment of infatuation, attempted
to acquire his information
from the work of Sir Emerson Tenant,
which was published about two
years ago, entitled <cite>Christianity in Ceylon</cite>.
Those who are really interested
in the subject of Christianity will find
it treated of there in a cold, unsympathising
manner, calculated rather
to repel than to attract them. Indeed,
the unfavourable reception which this
book has already met with, proves that
the general public, but too little mindful
of Christianity at home, care as little
for its development in Ceylon as did
Sir Emerson himself during his late
administration as Colonial Secretary
of the island. Mr Baker has evidently
a much better appreciation of the popular
taste, when, instead of “Christianity,”
he gives us “The Rifle and
the Hound” in Ceylon; and we entertain
no doubt that the result will
prove this satisfactorily alike to himself
and to his publishers.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have, indeed, seldom perused
a work with a keener relish than the
one we have just laid down. Our
author has shown in it that he can
wield his pen as ably as he can handle
his rifle, and in his exciting description
of wild sports in Ceylon, he gives
the public a “view halloo” of the game
he is in sight of there, that must stir
within him the soul of every true
sportsman. But the interest of Mr
Baker’s book does not consist so much
in the telling and graphic manner
in which he relates his own adventures
and hairbreadth escapes, as
in the perfectly new character in
which he represents the island where
he has now permanently established
himself, and where he seems to be
enjoying existence in a capacity hitherto
untried in that tropical clime; for
he is no coffee-planter reconciling
himself to a solitary existence in the
jungle by the hope of speedily realising
what he terms “a comfortable
independence,” upon which to return
to his native land—or Ceylon civil servant,
revelling in the prospect of retiring
when he is grey-headed to enjoy
anything but a comfortable independence,
viz. £500 a-year, or half
the highest salary that splendid service
offers to unfortunate younger
sons. Nor is he stationed out here
with his regiment, altogether regardless,
as a soldier ought to be, of a comfortable
independence, and anxious to
keep his hand in for natives by shooting
elephants. He is no mere dilettante
sportsman, endeavouring to recover the
effects, and dissipate the recollections,
of half a dozen London seasons. He is
a <em>settler</em>—positively a settler in Ceylon.
If our preconceived impressions of
this colony be true, what a sanguine
temperament our author must possess,
to enable him to expose himself so
cheerfully to the attacks of fever and
wild beasts for the rest of his life.
There certainly never was such an
act of insanity perpetrated; he might
as well have emigrated to the infernal
regions at once. We have no doubt
his friends told him so before he quitted
the genial clime of his native
land. But before we condemn him
so roundly, let us see where he has
pitched his tent, and what sort of
answer he sends back to the inquiries
of these anxious friends of his.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, then, I am in my private sanctum,
my rifles all arranged in their respective
stands above the chimney-piece,
the stag’s horns round walls hung with
horn-cases, powder-flasks, and the various
weapons of the chase. Even as I write,
the hounds are yelling in the kennel.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The thermometer is at 62° Fahr., and
it is mid-day. It never exceeds 72° in
the hottest weather, and sometimes falls
below freezing point at night. The
sky is spotless, and the air calm. The
fragrance of mignonettes, and a hundred
flowers that recall Old England, fill the
air. Green fields of grass and clover,
neatly fenced, surround a comfortable
house and grounds. Well-fed cattle of
the choicest breeds, and English sheep,
are grazing in the paddocks. Well made
roads and gravel walks run through the
estate. But a few years past, and this
was all wilderness.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dense forest reigned where now not
even the stump of a tree is standing; the
wind howled over hill and valley, the
dank moss hung from the scathed branches,
the deep morass filled the hollows; but
all is changed by the hand of civilisation
and industry. The dense forests and
rough plains, which still form the boundaries
of the cultivated land, only add to
the beauty. The monkeys and parrots
are even now chattering among the
branches; and occasionally the elephant, in
his nightly wanderings, trespasses upon
the fields, unconscious of the oasis within
his territory of savage nature.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The still starlight night is awakened
by the harsh bark of the elk; the lofty
mountains, grey with the silvery moonlight,
echo back the sound, and the wakeful
hounds answer the well-known cry
by a prolonged and savage yell.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This is ‘Newera Ellia,’ the sanatorium
of Ceylon, the most perfect climate
of the world. It now boasts of a handsome
church, a public reading-room, a
large hotel, the barracks, and about
twenty private residences.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The adjacent country, of comparatively
table-land, occupies an extent of some
thirty miles in length, varying in altitude
from six thousand two hundred to seven
thousand feet, forming a base for the
highest peaks in Ceylon, which rise to
nearly nine thousand feet.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Alternate large plains, separated by
belts of forest, rapid rivers, waterfalls,
precipices, and panoramic views of
boundless extent, form the features of
this country, which, combined with the
sports of the place, render a residence at
Newera Ellia a life of health, luxury, and
independence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So Mr Baker is not quite a maniac
after all—in fact, his lines seem cast
in rather pleasant places; and, if we
may draw our own inferences from
the brief description he gives us of
his island home, the pleasures of the
chase are only resorted to as an agreeable
variation from the ordinary routine
of his agricultural pursuits. He is a
solitary specimen in Ceylon of that
race so highly respected in our own
country, which combines at once the
sportsman, the farmer, and the gentleman.</p>

<p class='c010'>It has ever been a matter of astonishment
to us that no sportsman of
the Cinnamon Isle has before this been
inspired by his romantic and adventurous
life to depict those scenes in
which he has himself revelled, so as
to allow the public the gratification
of participating, although only in imagination,
in wild sports of a nature as
exciting and hazardous as the manner
in which they are prosecuted is novel
and enjoyable. We have not only
explored, with Gordon Cumming, the
interior of South Africa, but have
been bored to death by exhibitions in
our own country of the trophies which
attest his courage and energy. Although
we have never visited the Far
West, we are as familiar with the life
of the buffalo-hunter or prairie Indian
as Washington Irving himself.—For
did we not live among trappers,
with the inimitable Ruxton for our
companion, while we have only just
returned from a solitary ramble with
Palliser. And so tired are we of shooting
tigers and hunting boars in India
with the Cockney who goes out for a
winter excursion, or the “Company’s”
lady who wishes to astonish her sisters
at home, and disgust her husband
at “the station,” that we should infinitely
prefer reading the account in
the county paper of the last run of the
subscription pack, to Mrs M.’s charming
description of the Shickar at
B——, and the grand Tomasha
with which it terminated. And, indeed,
if we are accused of giving too
unfavourable an impression of Indian
sport, it is because, when we compare
our own experiences of sport in Bengal
with that in Ceylon, we feel that
the merits of the latter have been
utterly ignored and overwhelmed by
a profusion of rubbishy, exaggerated
pictures of tiger-hunting and pig-sticking,
half of which have been drawn, as
a sportsman can at once detect, by
those who have never seen a tiger or
a wild boar before they gave us this
account of their “fearful adventures.”
We certainly will maintain that sport
in India is very far inferior to sport
in Ceylon, inasmuch as it is much more
exciting to shoot an elephant than to
ride one. The insipidity of rocking
about on the back of an elephant,
looking for a tiger among long grass,
and running away or not when you
find one, as it suits the fancy of the
mahout or the elephant, is easily appreciated
by those who have ever indulged
in the delectable amusement
of stalking a “rogue,” with nothing
but a pair of rifle barrels and a pair of
stout legs to trust to. We engage to
say, that if there were as much elephant-shooting
in Ceylon as there is
tiger-shooting in India, the proportion
of deaths in the former country
would be as ten to one. We will admit
that “shickar” arrangements are
made on a much more magnificent
and luxurious scale in India than in
Ceylon; but this is a very secondary
consideration with the true sportsman,
and we certainly never enjoyed
life more thoroughly at any time
than while making our jungle trips in
those wild districts in Ceylon which
are so plentifully stocked with game.
What an independent existence was
that! far from the haunts of men by
some secluded tank,—a monument of
the industry and greatness of a race
long since passed away,—shadowed
over by the lofty and graceful tamarind
tree, is pitched our snug little
single-poled tent. Some camp-stools
are our seats by day, and fit into one
another so as to form comfortable
beds; the small circular table is fixed
to the tent-pole; the canteen, some
green native baskets containing our
wardrobe, and a long range of guns,
complete the furniture. It is mid-day,
and the occupants are taking a
<em>siesta</em> in their pyjamas; the coolies
are snoring where the jungle forms
the densest shade; the cook and
servants have built a house for themselves
of branches, and are engaged
in culinary occupations. No sooner
is the intense heat of mid-day past
than we sally forth, working steadily
for about four hours; then comes the
luxurious fare known well to the Ceylon
hunter. Our coolies and ourselves
are alike dependent entirely on our
trusty rifles. We sometimes indulge
in beer, but it is a most extravagant
practice—always, however, in a good
cook. It is not yet quite dusk: we
dine in the open air. There is roast
peafowl with buffalo tongue, venison
pasty and jugged hare, with a curry
of jungle fowl, with pigs’ fry, if we
are not otherwise well supplied; but,
as a general rule, wild boar is to be
avoided, especially if dead elephants
are abundant in the vicinity. Presently
the full moon in the cloudless
sky throws the shadows long and
sharp over our encampment, and we
prepare for night-work. Our tent is
quite concealed from the tank to which
we now repair: it is about three-quarters
dry, and the water is not
more than half a mile in circumference.
There are two round holes
prepared for our reception close to
the water’s edge, of sufficient depth to
conceal the occupants. All through
the night, with the moon looking
calmly down upon us, brightly reflected
in the waters of the tank, we
watch. As it is early yet, there are
plenty of buffaloes still to be seen.
Soon large herds of deer come down
to drink; they are quite unsuspicious,
and pass to and fro within
a few yards of the loaded rifles. Then
the sharp bark of the elk rings through
the still air, and a noble buck walks
knee deep into the water, and a moment
afterwards the doe more timidly
follows. Large sounders of pigs grunt
about constantly. After midnight,
more important game appears, and
rouses the eager sportsmen to more
vigorous action; whether we have
made a bag or not depends upon
whether there are elephants in the
neighbourhood. If there are, they
will now be heard crashing through
the jungle. They come very slowly,
and the excitement is intense; they
keep stopping by the way, and beating
about with their trunks. We are
getting very impatient—they never
will come! At last, one after another,
they stalk across the open in the clear
moonlight; a large herd is soon
splashing, and bubbling, and roaring
in the muddy water. They are
out of shot, and we are obliged to
stalk them, for moonlight shooting
is deceptive, and we have put lime on
the sight of the guns—a precaution, by
the way, we do not hear that Mr
Baker adopted when shooting by
moonlight. We no sooner fire than
the uproar and noise of the retreating
elephants are tremendous: they seldom
charge at night, the whole transaction
being too sudden and mysterious;
but the crashing of the jungle,
as the terrified herd sweeps through
it, is inconceivable. An hour or two
before daybreak chetahs and bears
come stealthily down and stay for a
moment, and are gone again. In the
course of one night, in the northern
part of Ceylon, we have literally seen
and fired at every description of the
game we have just enumerated. At
daybreak we swallow a quantity of
warm strong coffee, and only return
when the barrels of our rifles become
too hot to hold, unless, indeed, we are
absolutely on the track of an elephant,
and then the blazing sun itself is despised.
On our way home we discharge
our rifles at the scaly backs of
innumerable alligators that bask open-mouthed
upon the sloping bank, but
never with the hope of getting, though
sometimes of killing, one. We have
occasionally put a ball between the
greaves of their armour, but can testify
most assuredly (although Mr
Baker seems to doubt it) that an
alligator’s back will turn a rifle ball
at twenty yards, as upon one occasion
the ball from a friend’s rifle
lodged in a tree above us, although
he was standing at a distance of about
a hundred yards off, and the alligator
at which he had fired was in a totally
opposite direction. And so the days
fly past, and our trip is at an end, while
our appetite for excitement and adventure
remains unappeased; but we
are soon reconciled to the change from
the rough jungle-life to the comforts
of civilisation, for with them we combine
the invigorating air of the mountains,
and sport of another kind. The
tent is exchanged at Newera Ellia for
the warm thatched cottage, with its
rustic porch covered with sweet-pea
and honeysuckle, and well-furnished
carpeted rooms, where a comfortable
wood-fire crackles upon every hearth,
and sheds its grateful influence upon
the party gathered round it, and
which is composed of the most diverse
materials. Bengal civilians, who were
supposed to be dying when they left
the Sandheads, are narrating with no
little satisfaction their exploits in the
morning’s elk-hunt; officers from
Colombo, and middies from Trincomalee,
are eagerly canvassing the
prospects for the morrow; coffee-planters,
tourists, and Ceylon officials,
have become excellent friends on short
acquaintance, and are all burning to
distinguish themselves. At 5 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>
it requires some courage to emerge
from beneath a couple of warm
blankets: the ground is covered with
a thick hoar-frost, and fingers long
accustomed to wield a pen in some
Indian cutcherry can scarcely hold the
reins. Enterprising ladies, with very
red tips to their noses, join the party,
and the meet is a gay and animated
scene. But we must not follow the
fortunes of the hunt—our reminiscences
have already led us beyond
the orthodox limits of a review—and
we shall gladly turn to Mr Baker for
a description of those sports which he,
in common with ourselves, so highly
appreciates. We would first, however,
say a few words more in reference
to the lovely spot in which he
has taken up his abode, and of which
he has unfortunately given us a very
meagre account.</p>

<p class='c010'>The few Englishmen of a lower
class in society who have found their
way to Newera Ellia are thriving
well; they are, for the most part,
discharged soldiers, or persons whose
original object, in coming to Ceylon,
was to superintend coffee plantations.
English blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers,
or tailors, are all sure of plenty
of employment; while storekeeping, or
taking charge of the residences of those
government functionaries who are fortunate
enough to possess them, is a
profitable occupation. The great drawback
to extensive settling in Newera
Ellia, is the absence of a permanent
market. At some seasons of the year
the plain is overflowing with civilians
and military men from the lower provinces,
or from the continent of India,
who flock to enjoy its bracing climate;
at other times visitors are few and far
between, and the produce must be
transported in bullock-carts to Kandy
or Colombo.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nearest coffee plantations are
situated in Dimboola, seven or eight
miles distant, the elevation of the
plain being too great for the growth
of the berry. All the ordinary productions
of our kitchen-gardens are to be
procured in abundance, and delicious
strawberries may here be grown, to
recall to the acclimatised Company’s
servant the long-forgotten tastes of
his native land. There can be no
doubt that when the merits of Newera
Ellia become better known they will
be more highly appreciated, while
its proximity to India will then insure
those who have settled there a
speedy and profitable return for their
outlay.</p>

<p class='c010'>We regret that the scope and tenor
of Mr Baker’s work do not admit of a
full account of his farming experiences,
which must have been both novel and
interesting. His sketches of scenery
are graceful and life-like, evincing a
warm susceptibility and a cultivated
mind—qualities which must ever distinguish
the thorough sportsman from
a mere butcher on a large scale. “To
a true sportsman,” says our author,
“the enjoyment of a sport increases
in proportion to the wildness of the
country.” The deliberate manner in
which Mr Baker awaits the furious
charge of a rogue elephant, with his
rifle on full cock, wrapped in the contemplation
of the beauties of nature,
is truly appalling to us uninitiated
Westerns; and, indeed, at these
critical moments he is ever most enthusiastic—a
very Izaak Walton of
Nimrods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a mournful silence in the
calmness of the evening, when the tropical
sun sinks upon the horizon, a conviction
that man has left this region undisturbed
to its wild tenants. No hum of
distant voices, no rumbling of busy
wheels, no cries of domestic animals
meet the ear. He stands upon a wilderness,
pathless and untrodden by the foot
of civilisation, where no sound is ever heard
but that of the elements, when the thunder
rolls among the towering forests, or
the wind howls along the plains. He
gazes far, far into the distance, where
the blue mountains melt into an indefinite
haze; he looks above him to the rocky
pinnacles which spring from the level
plain, their swarthy cliffs glistening from
the recent shower, and patches of rich
verdure clinging to precipices a thousand
feet above him. His eye stretches along
the grassy plains, taking at one full
glance a survey of woods, and rocks, and
streams; and imperceptibly his mind
wanders to thoughts of home, and in one
moment scenes long left behind are conjured
up by memory, and incidents are
recalled which banish for a time the scene
before him. Lost for a moment in the
enchanting power of solitude, where fancy
and reality combine in their most bewitching
forms, he is suddenly roused by
a distant sound, made doubly loud by
the surrounding silence—the shrill trumpet
of an elephant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a good specimen of our author
in his softer moods; but we must hurry
on to more stirring scenes. Some
seven or eight years ago Mr Baker
visited Ceylon on a sporting tour, and
the first part of his volume is devoted
to an account of his adventures upon
that occasion. He subsequently returned
to Ceylon, and, making Newera
Ellia his permanent headquarters, he
enjoyed elk-hunting at his own doors;
and, having profited by former experience,
made his elephant-shooting
excursions in a deliberate and well-organised
manner. His battery consisted
“of one four-ounce rifle (a
single barrel) weighing twenty-one
pounds, one long two-ounce rifle (single
barrel) weighing sixteen pounds,
and four double-barrelled rifles, No.
10, weighing each fifteen pounds.”
The No. 10 double barrels did most
execution, and were twelve-grooved,
carrying a conical ball of two ounces
and a half. It is certainly a popular
delusion to suppose that smooth bores
are better than these for elephant-shooting.
We have already enumerated
the varieties of game at which
this formidable battery is directed.</p>

<p class='c010'>About eighty miles to the north-east
of Kandy, the lake of Minneria
lies embosomed amid the most luxuriant
vegetation, presenting a sheet of
water twenty miles in circumference;
and here, far distant from the haunts
of men, surrounded by some of the
loveliest scenery which Ceylon can
boast, Mr Baker introduces us to his
first buffalo. Our author’s brother
is the only companion of his sport;
they have just arrived in the island,
and consequently are complete novices
in its wild sports. No sooner
do they reach Minneria than, carried
away by the excitement of such close
proximity to their noble game, they
sally forth to attack a herd of buffaloes,
improperly supplied with ammunition.
A bull charges and is wounded, the
herd retreats, and our author, leaving
his brother to extinguish the
wounded bull, follows another, who
disdains a rapid flight. He is at
length overtaken, and as he faces
about to his pursuer, Mr Baker puts
two balls into his chest at fifteen paces,
without effect, “save that his eye,
which had hitherto been merely sullen,
was now beaming with fury, but his
form was motionless as a statue.”
This is decidedly startling—more
startling still to find that there is not
another ball left. It was now the
bull’s turn. “I dared not turn to
retreat, as I knew he would immediately
charge, and we stared one
another out of countenance.” For a
quarter of an hour Mr B. stares
fiercely but hopelessly at his maddened
antagonist, then a bright
thought flashes across him:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Without taking my eyes off the animal
before me, I put a double charge of
powder down the right-hand barrel, and
tearing off a piece of my shirt, I took all
the money from my pouch, three shillings
in sixpenny pieces, and two anna pieces,
which I luckily had with me in this small
coin for paying coolies. Quickly making
them into a rouleau with the piece of rag,
I rammed them down the barrel, and
they were hardly well home before the
bull again sprang forward. So quick was
it that I had no time to replace the ramrod,
and I threw it in the water, bringing
my gun on full cock in the same instant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His brother now comes up:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was the work of an instant. B.
fired without effect. The horns were
lowered, their points were on either side
of me, and the muzzle of the gun barely
touched his forehead when I pulled the
trigger, and three shillings’ worth of small
change rattled into his hard head. Down
he went, and rolled over with the suddenly
checked momentum of his charge.
Away went B. and I as fast as our heels
would carry us, through the water and
over the plain, knowing that he was not
dead but only stunned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We have generally found in the
course of our own short experience
that there was nothing for meeting a
charge like a little ready money, but
this is squaring accounts with a vengeance.
In a moment more Mr Baker
must inevitably have paid the debt of
nature—he paid 3s. 6d. instead, and
we will venture to say he never before
spent that sum more quickly
or satisfactorily to himself. Upon
the following day our two sportsmen
are charged by a herd, and again
narrowly escape destruction. “Although,”
says Mr Baker, “I have
since killed about two hundred wild
buffaloes, I have never witnessed
another charge by a herd. This was an
extraordinary occurrence, and fortunately
stands alone in buffalo-shooting.”
Mr Baker only thinks it necessary
to select from his extensive
buffalo-shooting experiences those
occasions which involved considerable
personal hazard, and exhibited, at
the same time, the extraordinary
courage and instinct of the animal.
Unless buffalo-shooting be followed
up as a sport by itself, the real character
of the animal must remain unknown.
“Some will fight and some
will fly, and no one can tell which
will take place—it is at the option of
the beast. Caution and good shooting,
combined with heavy rifles, are
necessary. Without heavy metal the
sport would be superlatively dangerous,
if regularly followed up.” Mr
Baker places great confidence in, and is
not a little proud of, his heavy rifles, and
he gives some wonderful instances of
his performances with them, which
fully justify his high estimate of their
capabilities. The last day’s work on
the occasion of his subsequent visits to
Minneria is worthy of record. He
begins by knocking over a bull at
three hundred and fifty-two paces,
then a cow from horseback at a long
range, and a bull at about four hundred
yards. These are mere experiments;
presently he comes to closer
quarters. A young bull is hidden in a
thick cover, and our author rides in to
dislodge him:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beat about to no purpose for about
twenty minutes, and I was on the point
of giving it up when I suddenly saw the
tall reeds bow down just before me. I
beard the rush of an animal as he burst
through, and I just saw the broad black
nose, quickly followed by the head and
horns, as the buffalo charged into me.
The horse reared to his full height as the
horns almost touched his chest, and I
fired as well as I was able. In another
instant I was rolling on the ground, with
my horse upon me, in a cloud of smoke
and confusion.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In a most unsportsmanlike manner (as
persons may exclaim who were not there),
I hid behind my horse as he regained his
legs. All was still—the snorting of the
frightened horse was all that I could
hear. I expected to have seen the infuriated
buffalo among us. I peeped over
the horse’s back, and, to my delight and
surprise, I saw the carcass of the bull
lying within three feet of him. His head
was pierced by the ball exactly between
the horns, and death had been instantaneous.
The horse having reared to his
full height, had entangled his hind legs in
the grass, and he had fallen backwards
without being touched by the buffalo, although
the horns were close into him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On his way home, after this disagreeable
rencontre, Mr Baker falls
in with a small herd of five, and drops
both bulls and an infuriated cow, the
latter in the act of charging, at a
distance of fifteen paces. The two
remaining cows and a calf are killed
in their retreat, and Mr Baker is
strolling home satisfied with a bag
of ten buffaloes, when he suddenly
stumbles upon a herd of elephants.
These beat an immediate retreat.
But singling out a fine bull, Mr Baker
drops him severely wounded with the
four ounce, and, taking his second gun,
he runs up just in time to catch him
as he is half risen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Feeling sure of him, I ran up within
two yards of his head, and fired into his
forehead. To my amazement, he jumped
quickly up, and with a loud trumpet he
rushed towards the jungle. I could just
keep close alongside him, as the grass was
short, and the ground level, and being determined
to get him, I ran close to his
shoulder, and, taking a steady shot behind
the ear, I fired my remaining barrel. Judge
of my surprise,—it only increased his
speed, and in another moment he reached
the jungle: he was gone. He seemed to
bear a charmed life. I had taken two
shots within a few feet of him that I would
have staked my life upon. I looked at
my gun. Ye gods! I had been firing
<em>snipe shot</em> at him. It was my rascally
horsekeeper, who had actually handed
me the shot-gun, which I had received as
the double-barrelled ball-gun, that I knew
was carried by a gun-bearer. How I did
thrash him! If the elephant had charged
instead of making off, I should have been
caught, to a certainty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This is a judgment upon him evidently
for boasting too much of his
battery. The abundance of game at
Minneria, however, is not to be compared
to the enormous sports which
Mr Baker finds in the almost unexplored
country beyond Hambautotte.
“Here the deer were in such masses
that I restricted myself to bucks, and
I at length became completely satiated.
There was too much game.
During a whole day’s walk I was certainly
not five minutes without seeing
either deer, elk, buffaloes, or hogs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gradually our sportsman gets still
more particular; he refuses tempting
shots, and goes out simply in search
of large antlers. None appearing of
sufficient size he does not fire, and
only kills buffaloes if they look vicious,
and he can get a charge out of them.
Notwithstanding this dainty shooting,
he comes home one morning to breakfast,
at eight o’clock, with three fine
bucks and two buffaloes in his bag.
Altogether we cannot charge Mr Baker
with indiscriminate slaughter. A
thorough sportsman, he is a humane
man; but if we may so phrase it, he
is a little too conscientious in his sport.
He gives us glimpses of much that is
interesting in his search after game;
but, because it is unconnected with the
matter in hand, he hurries us away
upon the track of a rogue elephant or
a buffalo, and will not allow us to
linger for a moment upon those fairy
scenes which he has himself conjured
up, or to inquire more deeply into
subjects of interest he has himself
suggested. We should have liked to
have heard a little more of the Veddahs,
for instance; but the district they
inhabit is the finest part of Ceylon for
sport, so of course we must not expect
to be told about wild men when there
are wild beasts in the case. We have,
however, a brief description of the
manners and habits (or rather want
of habits) of the animal:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Veddah in person is extremely
ugly; short, but sinewy; his long uncombed
locks fall to his waist, looking
more like a horse’s tail than human hair.
He despises money; but is thankful for a
knife, a hatchet, or a gaudy-coloured
cloth, or brass pot for cooking. The women
are horribly ugly, and are almost
entirely naked. They have no matrimonial
regulations, and the children are
squalid and miserable. Still these people
are perfectly happy, and would prefer
their present wandering life to the most
luxurious restraint. Speaking a language
of their own, with habits akin to those
of wild animals, they keep entirely apart
from the Cingalese. They barter deer-horns
and bees’-wax with the travelling
Moormen pedlars in exchange for their
trifling requirements. If they have food
they eat it; if they have none they go
without until by some chance they procure
it. In the mean time they chew the
bark of various trees, and search for berries,
while they wend their way for many
miles to some remembered store of deer’s
flesh and honey, laid by in a hollow tree.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They are expert trackers, but are
not so skilled in the use of bows and
arrows as savages usually are. Without
any fixed place of residence, they
wander over their beautiful country,
always finding abundance to eat and
drink, while the warm temperature
renders any description of clothing
superfluous. Upon another occasion,
Mr Baker, in search of elephants,
stumbles upon the ruins of Mahagam.
As he is unsuccessful in finding any
game, he gives us a short description
of what remains of this ancient city,
the first records of which date back to
the year 286 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>“We were among the ruins of ancient
Mahagam. One of the ruined buildings
had apparently rested upon seventy-two
pillars. These were still erect, standing
in six lines of twelve columns: every
stone appeared to be about fourteen feet
high by two feet square, and twenty-five
feet apart. This building must therefore
have formed an oblong of three hundred
feet by one hundred and fifty. Many of
the granite blocks were covered with
rough carving; large flights of steps,
now irregular from the inequality of the
ground, were scattered here and there;
and the general appearance of the ruins
was similar to that of Pollanarua, but
of smaller extent. The stone causeway
which passed through the ruins was about
two miles in length, being for the most
part overgrown with low jungle and
prickly cactus. I traversed the jungle
for some distance, until arrested by the
impervious nature of the bushes; but
wherever I went the ground was strewed
with squared stones and fallen brickwork
overgrown with rank vegetation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At Pollanarua the ruins are still
more interesting, and our author is evidently
just becoming romantic when
his reveries are disturbed in a manner
inexcusable even in a sportsman. He
is strolling through shady glades, and
moralising over palaces which have
crumbled into shapeless mounds of
bricks: “Massive pillars, formed of a
single stone some twelve feet high,
stand in upright rows throughout the
jungle here and there over an extent
of miles of country. The buildings
which they once supported have long
since fallen, and the pillars now stand
like tombstones over vanished magnificence.”
While Mr Baker is wandering
amid these ruins, meditating upon
the touching mementoes by which he
is surrounded, of a race long since
passed away—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Comes gliding in serene and slow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soft and silent as a dream,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A solitary doe.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Instead of quoting Wordsworth,
what does Mr Baker do? “I was
within twenty yards of her before she
was aware of my vicinity, and I bagged
her by a shot with a double-barrelled
gun. At the report of the gun a herd
of about thirty deer which were concealed
among the ruins rushed close
by me, and I bagged another doe with
the remaining barrel.” Really Mr
Baker should be ashamed of bagging
does right and left amid pillars which
stand as tombstones over vanished
magnificence; or, if it was the effect
of an impulse irresistible at the moment,
the placid reader should be
spared the sudden shock which such
an admission is likely to cause.</p>

<p class='c010'>The most extensive ruins are strewn
over all this country, those of Anarajapoura,
comprising a surface of two
hundred and fifty-six square miles,
being the most celebrated. Numerous
tanks attest the existence of a dense
population, where now elephants and
buffaloes roam unmolested. The tank
at Doolana, a secluded spot, is a
favourite resort for single or rogue
elephants; and here Mr Baker and
his brother find a notorious pair,
and determine upon their destruction.
The difficulty of following an
elephant through the dense forests
of Ceylon is so great that the assistance
of native trackers is often
absolutely necessary. In this instance,
unfortunately, even the trackers
mistake the direction, and our two
sportsmen are standing hopelessly
near a wall of impenetrable jungle,
into which the elephants had been
seen to retreat, wondering how they
are ever to achieve the desired end,
when, says Mr Baker,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suddenly heard a deep guttural
sound in the thick rattan within four
feet of me; in the same instant the whole
tangled fabric bent over me, and, bursting
asunder, showed the furious head of
an elephant with uplifted trunk in full
charge upon me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I had barely time to cock my rifle,
and the barrel almost touched him as I
fired. I knew it was in vain, as his trunk
was raised. B. fired his right-hand barrel
at the same moment without effect
from the same cause. I jumped on one
side and attempted to spring through the
deep mud: it was of no use; the long
grass entangled my feet, and in another
instant I lay sprawling in the enraged
elephant’s path within <em>a foot</em> of him. In
that moment of suspense I expected to
hear the crack of my own bones as his
massive foot would be upon me. It was
an atom of time. I heard the crack of a
gun; it was B.’s last barrel. I felt a
spongy weight strike my heel, and, turning
quickly heels over head, I rolled a
few paces and regained my feet. That
last shot had floored him just as he was
upon me; the end of his trunk had fallen
upon my heel. Still he was not dead, but
he struck at me with his trunk as I
passed round his head to give him a
finisher with the four-ounce rifle, which
I had snatched from our solitary gun-bearer.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My back was touching the jungle
from which the rogue had just charged,
and I was almost in the act of firing
through the temple of the still struggling
elephant when I heard a tremendous
crash in the jungle behind me similar to
the first, and the savage scream of an
elephant. I saw the ponderous fore-leg
cleave its way through the jungle directly
upon me. I threw my whole weight
back against the thick rattans to avoid
him, and the next moment his foot was
planted within an inch of mine. His lofty
head was passing over me in full charge
at B., who was unloaded, when, holding
the four-ounce rifle perpendicularly, I
fired exactly under his throat. I thought
he would fall upon me and crush me, but
this shot was the only chance, as B. was
perfectly helpless.</p>

<p class='c017'>“A dense cloud of smoke from the
heavy charge of powder for the moment
obscured everything. I had jumped out
of the way the instant after firing. The
elephant did not fall, but he had his
death wound: the ball had severed his
jugular, and the blood poured from the
wound. He stopped, but, collecting his
stunned energies, he still blundered forward
towards B. He, however, avoided
him by running to one side, and the
wounded brute staggered on through
the jungle. We now loaded the guns;
the first rogue was quite dead, and we
followed in pursuit of rogue number
two.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had received his death wound,
and was found dead in the jungle a day
or two afterwards. We have no doubt
a large proportion of those who take
up Mr Baker’s book, will read this, and
many other similar adventures which
it contains, in a spirit of profound
scepticism. Of course, we cannot
vouch for their credibility otherwise
than by saying that, from our own
experience and our knowledge of
the experience of others, we believe
not only in the possibility, but in
the probability of scenes such as
those described by Mr Baker frequently
occurring in a long course of
elephant-shooting. When a man can
show three hundred or four hundred
tails adorning the walls of his room,
he may fairly expect us to consider
them as vouchers for his own good
faith; and carpet sportsmen may laugh
as they please, but they will find, if
they have got the pluck to try to
procure similar ornaments, that elephants
don’t generally allow their tails
to be cut off without fighting for them,
and that the mild specimen in the
Zoological Gardens is not altogether
to be taken as a type of the race generally.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have often heard people exclaim,”
says Mr Baker, “upon hearing anecdotes
of elephant-hunting, ‘poor things!’</p>

<p class='c017'>“Poor things, indeed! I should like
to see the very person who thus expresses
his pity going at his best pace with a
savage elephant after him: give him a
lawn to run upon if he likes, and see the
elephant gaining a foot in every yard of
the chase, fire in his eye, fury in his headlong
charge; and would not the flying
gentleman who lately exclaimed ‘poor
thing!’ be thankful to the lucky bullet
that would save him from destruction?</p>

<p class='c017'>“There are no animals more misunderstood
than elephants; they are naturally
savage, wary, and revengeful, displaying
as great courage when in their wild state
as any animal known. The fact of their
natural sagacity renders them the more
dangerous as foes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course, in describing a series of
rencontres, involving so much personal
peril as must necessarily be the
accompaniment of elephant-shooting,
there is much scope for exaggeration,
and the more marvellous a story really
is, the more susceptible it is of colouring;
so that, unless the narrator be
continually on his guard, he may insensibly
be drawn, by the exciting
nature of the incidents he recounts,
into a way of relating them which
smacks so strongly of undue embellishment,
that the ignorant reader is
disposed to discredit those facts themselves
which, had he possessed personal
experience, he would not have
hesitated to accept. “Often,” says Mr
Baker, who anticipates such unlearned
criticism, “have I pitied Gordon Cumming,
when I have heard him talked
of as a palpable Munchausen by men
who never fired a rifle or saw a wild
beast except in a cage, and still these
men form the greater proportion of
the readers of these works.” And we
are assured by our author that he has
carefully abstained from working up
his scenes for the sake of effect—that,
in fact, if he has erred at all, it is
in under-drawing them. Now, although
we would not for a moment
be supposed to discredit any one of
the accounts which he gives us of his
adventures, we cannot do Mr Baker
the injustice to agree with him in this,
and we consider ourselves competent
judges, although we may not have been
present. In looking over the illustrations
which grace the work, and which
are spiritedly done, there appeared to
us one fault, if fault it may be called;
our author and his friends always seem
to be shooting with air-guns—there is
a remarkable absence of any smoke.
Now, without meaning in the least to
infer that Mr Baker has transferred it
from the pictorial representations of
those scenes of which its presence
would have been the appropriate
ornament to the descriptions of them,
which would suffer seriously from
such an addition, we only remark
that he has occasionally given a handle
for that sort of criticism, which we, in
common with himself, so much deprecate.
We wish, for instance, that his
measurements of distance in moments
of extreme peril had been a little more
vague than they are.  A striking
instance of the precision with which
our author calculates distance occurs
in the course of one of his elephant
hunts; after a long combat with a
rogue, he is obliged to throw away
his heavy rifle and take to his heels.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had about three feet start of him,
and I saw with delight that the ground
was as level and smooth as a lawn; there
was no fear of tripping up, and away I
went at the fastest pace that I ever ran
either before or since, taking a look behind
me to see how the chase went on. I saw
the bullet-mark in his forehead, which
was covered with blood; his trunk was
stretched to its full length to catch me,
and was now within two feet of my back:
he was gaining on me, although I was
running at a tremendous pace. I could
not screw an inch more speed out of my
legs, and I kept on, with the brute gaining
upon me at every stride. He was
within a foot of me, and I had not heard
a shot fired, and not a soul had come to
the rescue. The sudden thought struck
me that my brother could not possibly
overtake the elephant at the pace at
which we were going, and I suddenly
doubled short to my left into the open
plain, and back towards the guns. The
rogue overshot me. I met my brother
close to his tail,” &#38;c. &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c009'>We remember hearing that Major
Rogers once dodged between an
elephant’s legs; but Major Rogers’
presence of mind was nothing to
Mr Baker’s, who could deliberately
calculate his distance when at full
speed, and who, joyously trotting on
with an elephant’s trunk first three,
and then two feet from his back, does
not think it worth while to double
until the distance is decreased to
twelve inches. It is quite possible
that the elephant’s trunk was in most
unpleasant proximity to the fugitive—indeed,
a sporting friend of ours once
had his cap taken off by a rogue in
full chase, and after all fairly outran
his pursuer—so that <em>we</em> do not doubt
that Mr Baker had an uncommonly
near shave, and was excessively glad
to find his brother at his pursuer’s tail;
but this is just <em>the tone</em> of description
that gives rise to doubts in the minds
of those who do not happen ever to
have run away from an elephant.</p>

<p class='c010'>It may be said that the same remark
is applicable to the accounts we have
of the powers of the four-ounce. There
is an elephant killed stone dead at
one hundred and twenty yards; a
buffalo at six hundred, if not eight
hundred. These are both unprecedented
shots; but as sixteen drachms
is a common charge with Mr Baker,
and as we certainly never used a rifle
heavy enough to bear a charge of <em>an
ounce</em> of powder, we are not in a position
to question them. Moreover,
when we consider the performances
of the Minié, we are inclined to regard
them as quite possible, although distance,
if not actually measured, must
always be very much a matter of
opinion. However, in reading this
narrative of adventure, the experience
of an intrepid sportsman, it must be
remembered that only those incidents
are selected for relation which were
most remarkable or attended with the
greatest risk. They are a collection
of the most perilous moments of a life
of peril, and we have simply to add up
the long catalogue of those who have
fallen victims in Ceylon to that sport
which Mr Baker so ardently pursues,
to perceive its danger; and so far
from denying the possibility of those
hairbreadth escapes which startle us
in every page of this work, we should
then be induced rather to wonder that
its author still lives to tempt that
Providence by which he has hitherto
been so wonderfully preserved.</p>

<p class='c010'>But we must not allow the rifle an
undue share of our attention. Mr
Baker has as good reason to be proud
of his hounds as of his rifles, and there
is a greater novelty to the English
sportsman in hunting elk at Newera
Ellia than in shooting elephants or
buffaloes at Minneria. A buck elk—the
Samber deer of India—stands
about fourteen hands high at the
shoulder, and weighs about six hundred
pounds: he is in colour dark
brown, with a mane of coarse bristly
hair of six inches in length; the rest
of his body is covered with the same
coarse hair of about two inches in
length. His antlers are sometimes
upwards of three feet long, but seldom
have more than six points. He
is a solitary animal; when brought
to bay he fights to the last, and
charges man and hound indiscriminately,
a choice hound being often
the price of victory. The country
in which he is hunted is the mountainous
district in Ceylon; for though
he is to be found in almost every part
of the island, the sport is only prosecuted
at an elevation which varies
from four thousand to seven thousand
feet above the sea. The sharp, bracing
climate of Newera Ellia, while it agrees
admirably with the hounds, enables
the sportsman to undergo that prolonged
and violent exercise on foot
which the sport involves, and which
would be utterly out of the question
in the low country.</p>

<p class='c010'>The principal features of the highlands
of Ceylon being a series of wild
marshy plains, forests, torrents, mountains,
and precipices, a peculiar hound
is required for elk-hunting. Upon the
occasion of Mr Baker’s second visit, he
arrived with a pack of thorough-bred
foxhounds. These he soon found were
quite a mistake; they invariably open
upon the scent at a great distance,
and after warning the elk too soon,
they stick to him too long, and ultimately
fall victims to chetahs or
starvation, the penalty of inexperienced
perseverance. The offspring
of crosses with pointers, bloodhounds,
and half-bred foxhounds, are the
right stamp for the sport; while the
Australian lurcher proves often of
immense service upon the open. The
hero of Mr Baker’s pack was a Manilla
bloodhound of enormous strength
and indomitable pluck. The performances
of old Smut are worthy of
a volume to themselves; and if his
master could appreciate the merits of
his favourite hound when alive, he
proves himself an historian well qualified
to do justice to his memory. The
reader will also be proud to make
the acquaintance of Killbuck, Bran,
and Lena, who prove themselves
good dogs and true. About sixteen
miles from Newera Ellia, lie the
Horton Plains, situated at an elevation
of seven thousand feet above the
level of the sea. They are perfectly
uninhabited; and here it is that Mr
Baker introduces us to his favourite
sport. He and his friends have taken
up their abode in a snug corner of the
plains, where they have built for
themselves a hunting-lodge and kennel.
They are within hail of civilisation,
but they depend almost entirely
upon the dogs for sustenance, combined
with the efforts of a perfect
Soyer of a cook.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This knight of the gridiron was a
famous fellow, and could perform wonders;
of stoical countenance, he was
never seen to smile. His whole thoughts
were concentrated in the mysteries of
gravies, and the magic transformation of
one animal into another by the art of
cookery: in this he excelled to a marvellous
degree. The farce of ordering dinner
was always absurd. It was something
in this style. ‘Cook!’ (<em>Cook
answers</em>) ‘Coming sar!’ (<em>enter cook</em>).—‘Now,
cook, you make a good dinner; do
you hear?’ <em>Cook</em>: ‘Yes, sar: master
tell, I make.’—‘Well, mulligatawny
soup.’ ‘Yes, sar.’—‘Calves’ head, with
tongue, and brain-sauce.’ ‘Yes, sar.’—‘Gravy
omelette.’ ‘Yes, sar.’—‘Mutton
chops.’ ‘Yes, sar.’—‘Fowl cotelets.’
‘Yes, sar.’—‘Beefsteaks.’ ‘Yes, sar.’—‘Marrow-bones.’
‘Yes, sar.’—‘Rissoles.’
‘Yes, sar.’ All these various dishes he
literally imitated uncommonly well, the
different portions of an elk being their
only foundation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>During a trip of two months at the
Horton Plains, Mr Baker killed forty-three
elk, which was working the
pack pretty hard. At Newera Ellia
the game, though not quite so plentiful,
is sufficiently abundant to satisfy
any reasonable sportsman, and an
extract of three months’ hunting, at
his own door, from our author’s game-book,
shows a return of eleven bucks,
seventeen does, and four hogs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though the sport of elk-hunting is
most exciting, the recital of elk-hunting
experiences must ever be somewhat
monotonous: there is so little
room for varied incident. The hunter
follows the music of his pack over
the open, at a long swinging trot,
and bursts his way through the dense
jungle, and down the steep bank to
the foaming torrent, in the midst of
which the elk is keeping the hounds
at bay:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“There they are in that deep pool
formed by the river as it sweeps round
the rock. A buck! a noble fellow! Now
he charges at the hounds, and strikes the
foremost beneath the water with his forefeet;
up they come again to the surface,—they
hear their master’s well-known
shout,—they look round and see his welcome
figure on the steep bank. Another
moment, a tremendous splash, and he is
among his hounds, and all are swimming
towards their noble game. At them he
comes with a fierce rush. Avoid him
as you best can, ye hunters, man, and
hounds!”</p>

<p class='c009'>This reminds us of an amusing experience
of our own, under somewhat
similar circumstances. The master
of one of the packs at Newera Ellia,
in those days a good specimen of
a Ceylon Nimrod, and an old elk-hunter,
was anxious to show a naval
friend of his the sport in perfection.
We happened to be of the party, and
before long our ears were rejoiced
with that steady chorus which always
tells of a buck at bay. Away we
dashed through the thorny jungle,
and arrived at the edge of a deep
black pool, in which the elk was
swimming, surrounded by the entire
pack. Another moment and we
should have formed one of the damp
but picturesque group, when our naval
friend, who had been left a little in
the rear, unused to such rough work,
came up torn and panting. It suddenly
occurs to Nimrod, just as he is
going to jump in, that it is hardly civil
to his guest to secure to himself the
sportsman’s most delicious moment;
he feels the sacrifice he is making
as, with a forced blandness, and an
anxious glance at the buck, he presses
his hunting-knife into Captain F.’s
hand, saying, “After you, sir, pray.”
“Eh! after me; where?—you don’t
mean me to go in there, do you?”
“Certainly not, if you would rather
stay here; in that case be so good as
give me the knife, as there is no time
to be lost.” “Oh, ah!—I didn’t understand;—how
very stupid! Go in—oh
certainly: I shall be delighted;” and
in dashed the gallant captain with his
two-edged blade gleaming in the
morning sun. For a second the waters
closed over him, then he appeared
spluttering and choking, and waving
aloft the naked steel preparatory to
going down again; it was plain that
he could not swim a stroke, and it
cost us no little trouble to pull out the
plucky sailor, who took the whole
thing as a matter of course, and would
evidently have gone anywhere that
he had been told. It is a difficult
matter to stick an elk while swimming,
as the hide is very thick, and the
want of any sufficient purchase renders
an effective blow almost impossible.
There is also a great risk of
being struck by the elk’s fore-legs,
while impetuous young dogs are apt
to take a nip of their master by mistake.
A powerful buck at bay is
always a formidable customer, and
the largest dogs may be impaled like
kittens if they do not learn to temper
their valour with discretion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The only important drawback,”
says Mr Baker, “to the pleasure of elk-hunting
is the constant loss of dogs.
The best are always sure to go. What
with deaths by boars, leopards, elk,
and stray hounds, the pack is with
difficulty maintained. Poor old Bran,
who, being a thorough-bred greyhound,
is too fine in the skin for such rough
hunting, has been sewn up in so many
places that he is a complete specimen
of needlework;” while Killbuck
and Smut, the hero of about four
hundred deaths of elk and boar, have
terminated their glorious careers.
Killbuck was pierced by the sharp
antlers of a spotted buck, after a
splendid course over the plains in the
low country. If the bay of the deer
is not so good as that of the elk, the
enjoyment of riding to your game
renders deer-coursing a far more
agreeable sport than elk-hunting.
Unfortunately for Killbuck his buck
came to bay as pluckily as any elk,
and had pinned the noble hound to
the earth, before his master, who
had been thrown in the course of a
reckless gallop, could come up to
the rescue. But the boar is the most
destructive animal to the pack, and a
fierce immovable bay, in which every
dog joins in an impetuous chorus, is
always a dreaded sound to the hunter,
who knows well that tusks, and
not antlers, are at work.</p>

<p class='c010'>The following description of a boar
at bay will give some idea of the
scene that then occurs:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was a fight! The underwood
was levelled, and the boar rushed to and
fro with Smut, Bran, Lena, and Lucifer,
all upon him. Yoick to him! and some
of the most daring of the maddened pack
went in. The next instant we were upon
him mingled with a confused mass of
hounds; and throwing our whole weight
upon the boar, we gave him repeated
thrusts, apparently to little purpose.
Round came his head and gleaming tusks
to the attack of his fresh enemies, but
old Smut held him by the nose, and, although
the bright tusks were immediately
buried in his throat, the stanch old dog
kept his hold. Away went the boar
covered by a mass of dogs, and bearing
the greater part of our weight in addition,
as we hung on to the hunting-knives
buried in his shoulders. For about fifty
paces he tore through the thick jungle,
crashing it like a cobweb. At length he
again halted; the dogs, the boar, and
ourselves were mingled in a heap of confusion.
All covered with blood and dirt,
our own cheers added to the wild bay of
the infuriated hounds, and the savage
roaring of the boar. Still he fought and
gashed the dogs right and left. He stood
about thirty-eight inches high, and the
largest dogs seemed like puppies beside
him; still not a dog relaxed his hold, and
he was covered with wounds. I made a
lucky thrust for the nape of his neck. I
felt the point of the knife touch the bone;
the spine was divided, and he fell dead.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Smut had two severe gashes in the
throat, Lena was cut under the ear, and
Bran’s mouth was opened completely up
to his ear in a horrible wound.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the boar sometimes comes off
victorious; and the death of poor
old Smut has never been revenged.
He was almost cut in half before Mr
Baker reached the bay, which lasted
for an hour. At the end of that
period, Smut, gashed with many additional
wounds, was expiring, and
three of the best remaining dogs were
severely wounded; the dogs were
with difficulty called off the victorious
monster; and Mr Baker records, with
feelings of profound emotion, the only
defeat he ever experienced, and which
terminated fatally to the gallant leader
of his pack.</p>

<p class='c010'>The usual drawbacks and discomforts
attendant upon a new settlement
having been overcome, our author
assures us that Newera Ellia forms a
delightful place of residence. But it
must not be supposed that, on the
occasion of his second visit to Ceylon,
he confined himself to elk-hunting and
agriculture. He is frequently tempted
from his highland home to the elephant
country, which is only about
two days’ journey distant; and the
latter part of his volume abounds
with exciting descriptions of new encounters
with rogues, involving the
usual amount of personal hazard; and
lest the too ardent pursuit of this
fascinating sport seems scarcely to
justify the apparent cruelty it involves,
it must be remembered that
it is not more cruel to kill a large
animal than a small one, though this
is a distinction we are too apt to
make; and when the large animal is
also often destructive to life and property,
its slaughter is not only justifiable,
but commendable in those who
are disposed to risk their lives for the
benefit of the public and their own
gratification.</p>

<p class='c010'>Indeed, so extensive are the ravages
committed by elephants, that
a price is offered by government for
their tails; since, however, the procuring
of tails has become a fashionable
amusement among Europeans,
the reward has been reduced to the
miserable sum of 7s. 6d. The Moorish
part of the community were the recognised
elephant-slayers, so long as there
was profit to be made by these means.
They now devote themselves almost
entirely to the capture of elephants
alive for the purpose of exportation to
India. Mr Baker gives an amusing
account of having assisted to catch an
elephant. He started with his brother
and thirty Moormen, armed with
ropes, towards a herd of seven, of
whose presence in the neighbourhood
intelligence had been received. Upon
coming in sight of the herd, one was
selected for capture. Mr Baker and
his brother and their gun-bearers,
taking the wind, advance under cover
of the jungle to open the ball. This
they do in style, bagging six elephants
in almost the same number of minutes.
The seventh starts off in full retreat
with the multitude at his heels. At
last an active Moorman dexterously
throws a noose of thick but finely
twisted hide rope over one of his hind-legs.
Following the line which the unconscious
elephant trails after him like
a long snake, they wait until he enters
the jungle, and then unceremoniously
check his further progress by taking a
double turn round a tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Any but a hide rope of that diameter
must have given way; but this stretched
like a harp-string, and, at every effort to
break it, the yielding elasticity of the
hide threw him upon his head, and the
sudden contraction after the fall jerked
his leg back to its full length.</p>

<p class='c017'>“After many vain but tremendous efforts
to free himself, he turned his rage
upon his pursuers, and charged every one
right and left; but he was safely tied,
and we took some little pleasure in teasing
him. He had no more chance than
a fly in a spider’s web. As he charged
in one direction, several nooses were
thrown round his hind-legs; then his
trunk was caught in a slip-knot, then his
fore-legs, then his neck, and the ends of
all these ropes being brought together
and hauled tight, he was effectually
hobbled.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This had taken some time to effect
(about half an hour), and we now commenced
a species of harness to enable us
to drive him to the village.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The first thing was to secure his
trunk by tying it to one of his fore-legs;
this leg was then fastened with a slack
rope to one of his hind-legs, which prevented
him from taking a longer stride
than about two feet; his neck was then
tied to his other fore-leg, and two ropes
were made fast to both his fore and hind
legs; the ends of these ropes being manned
by thirty men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was then driven to the village,
and three days afterwards was sufficiently
tamed to be mounted. His
value was then about £15.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Baker at last becomes as dainty
in his elephant-shooting as we have
already found him in the deer country.
Where elephants are abundant he despises
a herd, and confines himself to
rogues, where they are procurable,
always singling out the most vicious-looking,
and this must in some measure
account for the redundancy of adventure
in his narrative. For though
elephant-shooting is always attended
with some risk, the comparative extent
of this depends entirely upon the
manner in which the sport is pursued.
If tails are the desiderata, then a herd
in a nice open jungle presents the best
chance of obtaining a supply with the
least possible amount of personal danger;
but if sport is really sought, then a
rogue upon the open is certain to afford
enough to satisfy the most ardent Nimrod
that ever drew trigger. The fatigue
of elephant-shooting is something
inconceivable to those who have not for
six or eight consecutive hours laboured
under a tropical sun with a heavy
rifle,—the barrels of which are so hot
that they can scarcely be touched,—over
wide plains, and through long
grass, matted over hidden rocks and
tangled jungle, with an underwood of
the twining bamboo and thorny
mimosa. It is only the most intense
excitement that could carry a man
through fatigue such as this; and a
prize worthy of all that he has undergone
is needed to reward him for the
day’s work. Under these circumstances,
it is clear that, the more imminent
the peril, the more satisfactory
is the sport considered. There would
be very little gratification in toiling
all day in a temperature of 130°, if
there was no opportunity presented of
risking one’s life. Mr Baker’s enjoyment
must have reached its climax
when he was actually wounded by an
elephant’s tusk. This indeed compensated
for much hardship and discomfort.
It happened in this wise:</p>

<p class='c010'>About two days’ journey from
Newera Ellia is situated a large tract
of country called the Park. This is
the most favourite resort of Ceylon
sportsmen, as elephants are generally
abundant. The scenery is beautiful,
of a character which may be inferred
from the name it now bears among
Europeans. It is of vast extent,
watered by numerous large rivers, and
ornamented by rocky mountains, such
as no English park can boast. The
lemon grass grows over the greater
part of this country to a height of
ten or twelve feet, and large herds
of elephants wander through it, the
crowns of their capacious brown heads,
or the tips of their trunks, tossed
occasionally into the air, alone attesting
their presence.</p>

<p class='c010'>A number of these appearing over
the waving grass, delight the eyes of
Mr Baker and his brother one morning
as they sally forth from their night
encampment with their usual deadly
intent. Upon discovering the daring
intruders, the herd, consisting of ten,
rally round the two leaders, whose
deep growls, like rumbling peals of
thunder, is the call in time of danger.
Our author and his brother immediately
advance towards the dense mass,
nothing daunted by so imposing an
array. A part of the herd beat a retreat,
but five charge viciously; they
are dropped in as many successive
shots, the last at a distance of only
ten paces; four more are slain in retreat,
a faithless mother alone escaping,
whose little charge, so unusually
deserted, Mr Baker captures, by taking
hold of his tail and trunk, and
throwing him on his back. Those
who have seen an unweaned elephant
calf will admit this to be no very
difficult feat. Having secured the
infant, and left him in charge of his
brother and the gun-bearers, Mr
Baker returns to seek his legitimate
trophies in the shape of tails.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had one barrel still loaded, and I
was pushing my way through the tangled
grass towards the spot where the five
elephants lay together, when I suddenly
heard Wallace shriek out, ‘Look out, sir!
Look out!—an elephant’s coming!’</p>

<p class='c017'>“I turned round in a moment; and
close past Wallace, from the very spot
where the last dead elephant lay, came
the very essence and incarnation of a
‘rogue’ elephant in full charge. His
trunk was thrown high in the air, his
ears were cocked, his tail stood high
above his back as stiff as a poker, and,
screaming exactly like the whistle of a
railway engine, he rushed upon me
through the high grass with a velocity
that was perfectly wonderful. His eyes
flashed as he came on, and he had singled
me out as his victim.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have often been in dangerous positions,
but I never felt so totally devoid of
hope as I did in this instance. The
tangled grass rendered retreat impossible.
I had only one barrel loaded, and
that was useless, as the upraised trunk
protected his forehead. I felt myself
doomed; the few thoughts that rush
through men’s minds in such hopeless
positions flew through mine, and I resolved
to wait for him till he was close
upon me before I fired, hoping that he
might lower his trunk and expose his
forehead.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He rushed along at the pace of a
horse in full speed; in a few moments,
as the grass flew to the right and left
before him, he was close upon me, but
still his trunk was raised and I would
not fire. One second more, and at this
headlong pace he was within three feet
of me; down slashed his trunk with the
rapidity of a whip-thong, and with a
shrill scream of fury he was upon me.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I fired at that instant; but in the
twinkling of an eye I was flying through
the air like a ball from a bat. At the
moment of firing I had jumped to the
left, but he struck me with his tusk in
full charge upon my right thigh, and
hurled me eight or ten paces from him.
That very moment he stopped, and, turning
round, he beat the grass about with
his trunk, and commenced a strict search
for me. I heard him advancing close to the
spot where I lay as still as death, knowing
that my last chance lay in concealment.
I heard the grass rustling close to the
spot where I lay; closer and closer he approached,
and he at length beat the grass
with his trunk several times exactly
above me. I held my breath, momentarily
expecting to feel his ponderous
foot upon me. Although I had not felt
the sensation of fear while I had stood
opposed to him, I felt like what I never
wish to feel again while he was deliberately
hunting me up. Fortunately I
had reserved my fire until the rifle had
almost touched him, for the powder and
smoke had nearly blinded him, and had
spoiled his acute power of scent. To my
joy I heard the rustling of the grass grow
fainter; again, I heard it at a still
greater distance; at length it was gone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There could not,” says our author
naïvely, “be a better exemplification
of a rogue than in this case.”
The knowing way in which he had
remained patiently concealed, while
his enemies expended their ammunition
and energies upon the herd, and
the sudden and furious manner in
which he came upon them, while unsuspectingly
appropriating the tails
of his brethren, quite justifies this
opinion of Mr Baker’s. He escapes
triumphantly, as he deserves to have
done, and leaves Mr Baker to contemplate
his wounded leg for some
days, during which he is unable to
move. We must do our author the
justice to say that he seeks his revenge
as soon as he is able to put his
foot to the ground, and a few days
afterwards we find him chasing a herd,
until he says “my leg, which had
lost all feeling, suddenly gave way,
and I lay sprawling on my face, incapable
of going a step farther. I
had killed four elephants; it was very
bad luck, as the herd consisted of
eleven, but my leg gave way when
most required.” If Mr Baker is not
satisfied, we are. We shall not,
therefore, follow him through the exciting
details of a jungle trip, with
which he concludes his most interesting
work, and from which he and his
two companions, the Hon. Mr Stuart
Wortley and Mr E. Palliser, return in
three weeks, with a bag of fifty elephants,
five deer, and two buffaloes.
We have said enough to indicate to the
reader in search of excitement by his
fireside where it is to be found—more
than enough to tempt the enthusiastic
sportsman to exchange for a season the
comforts of home for the wild stirring
life of the elephant-hunter; and we
may venture to assure him that he
will ever recur with delight to the
enjoyment and rough luxury that a
jungle trip alone affords, and he will
be ready to adopt, as we do ourselves,
the concluding words of our author:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The well-arranged tent, the neatly
spread table, the beds forming a triangle
around the walls, and the clean guns
piled in a long row against the gun-rack,
will often recall a <em>tableau</em> in after years,
in countries far from this land of independence.
The acknowledged sports of
England will appear child’s play; the
exciting thrill will be wanting, when a
sudden rush in the jungle brings the rifle
on full cock; and the heavy guns will
become useless mementos of past days,
like the dusty helmets of yore, hanging
up in an old hall. The belt and the
hunting-knife will alike share the fate of
the good rifle, and the blade, now so
keen, will blunt from sheer neglect.
The slips, which have held the necks of
dogs of such staunch natures, will hang
neglected from the wall; and all these
<em>souvenirs</em> of wild sports, contrasted with
the puny implements of the English
chase, will awaken once more the longing
desire for the ‘Rifle and the Hound in
Ceylon.’”</p>

  <h2 class='c002'>GRAY’S LETTERS.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c008'><sup>[13]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We do not intend upon the present
occasion, however legitimate the opportunity,
to trespass long upon the
patience of our readers, in discussing
the merits or demerits of Gray’s poetical
style. Some few remarks we
are tempted to make, chiefly of a conciliatory
character; but we shall very
rapidly pass on to his Life and Letters,
which are the more immediate subject
of the book before us. In critical
debates upon English poetry, the
name of Gray has been often a rallying
point for the disputants: he has
been held up as a bright example by
one party, and by another, as a salutary
warning to all youthful aspirants.
“Of all English poets,” says Sir
James Mackintosh, “he was the most
finished artist. He attained the highest
degree of splendour of which
poetical style seems to be capable.”
We all know what Wordsworth
thought of the splendour of this poetical
style, and how severely he and
others have dealt with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poetry is a very difficult subject to
reason about; and the more refined,
and the more bold, and the more
complex the associations of thought
in which it deals, the more difficult
does it become to prove, by any process
of argument, that it is good or
bad. As little can you teach a man
to <em>enjoy</em> poetry, to discover it when
it lies before him, by any rules, or
process of reasoning, analytic or synthetic,
as you could teach a man by
the same methods to <em>write</em> poetry.
For there is always in the more subtle
kinds of poetry an element of <em>unreason</em>;
plain truth is somewhere set at
defiance; and who can possibly draw the
line, or say precisely to what extent
imagination, under the sway of feeling
or sentiment, shall be allowed to
transgress on the palpable verities of
our senses, or our better judgment?
How can reason decide exactly, where
reason herself shall be set aside in
favour of emotion? Emotion, after
all, must have her voice in the matter;
and the final result must be some uncertain
compromise between them.</p>

<p class='c010'>We will draw an illustration of our
meaning from no vulgar critic. The
refined taste of Mr Landor will
be at once admitted; nor will he lie
open to the objection often brought
against our northern critics, that they
are too metaphysical or analytic in
their strictures upon metaphorical
language. We extract the two following
annotations, from his conversation
between himself and Southey,
on two several passages in <cite>Milton’s
Paradise Lost</cite>. They will aptly illustrate
the difficulty which every one
will encounter who has to reason upon
the right and wrong of a poet’s
imagination.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a beautiful expression is
there in verse 546, which I do not remember
that any critic has noticed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Obtain the brow of some <em>high-climbing</em> hill.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Here the hill itself is instinct with life
and activity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Agreed: it is a beautiful expression;
and if any one insists that a hill
does not climb, but is a thing to be
climbed upon, we pronounce him a
blockhead for his pains. Nevertheless
the blockhead has palpable truth upon
his side. The hill does not climb in
fact, and there is no process we know
of by which it can be made to climb
in his imagination. Now for our
second comment—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>“‘Sage he stood,</div>
      <div class='line'>With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear</div>
      <div class='line'>The weight of mightiest monarchies.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Often and often have these verses
been quoted without a suspicion how
strongly the corporeal is substituted
for the moral. However Atlantean
his shoulders might be, the might of
monarchies could no more be supported
by them than by the shoulders of
a grasshopper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here, Mr Landor takes part with
plain matter-of-fact against that play
of poetic imagination, which often
succeeds in making one deep and harmonious
impression out of incongruous
materials, merely by the dexterous
rapidity with which these are passed
before the mind. We confess to have
admired the bold, vague, instantaneous,
transitory combination of physical
with moral properties, which we
have in these celebrated lines. The
monarchies do not rest directly on
the “shoulders,” but on the sage man
with these broad shoulders, and the
epithet “Atlantean,” by suggesting
immediately a mythological person,
has already half allegorised the figure.
The shoulders which are for an instant
brought before the mind’s eye,
have never supported any less honourable
weight than that of a whole
world. Mr Landor, however, may
be right; we are not disputing the
correctness of his criticism; we are
only pointing out the inherent difficulties
of the subject. Mr Landor
may be right; but what answer would
he give to the man of plain understanding
who did not comprehend how
a hill could climb, and who should
insist upon it, that a mound of earth
could no more be “instinct with life
and activity” than broad shoulders
could help a man to govern well?</p>

<p class='c010'>Turning over the pages of a work
of Meinherr Feuchtersleben on Medical
Psychology, we met with the remark,
that the effort to enjoy or attend
to some of our finer sensations
was not always followed by an increase
in those pleasurable sensations.
Thus, he says, we distend our nostrils
and inspire vigorously when we would
take our fill of some agreeable odour,
and yet certain of the more refined
scents escape us by this very effort
to seize and appropriate them. Passing
by a bed of violets, the flowers
themselves perhaps unseen, how
charming a fragrance has hit upon
the unwarned sense! Turn back,
and strenuously inhale for the very
purpose of enjoying it more fully, the
fairy favour has escaped you. It
floated on the air, playing with the
sense of him who sought not for it;
but quite refusing to be fed upon voraciously
by the prying and dilated
nostril. Something like this may be
observed in the case of poetical enjoyment.
The susceptible reader feels
it, though he sought it not, and the
more varied the culture of his mind,
the more likely is he to be visited by
this pleasure; but it will not be captured
by any effort of hard, vigorous
attention, or the merely scrutinising
intellect. The poetry of the verse,
like the fragrance of the violet, will
not be rudely seized; and he who
knits his brow and strains his faculty
of thought over the light and musical
page may wonder how it happens
that the charm grows less as his desire
to fix and to appropriate it has
increased.</p>

<p class='c010'>When, therefore, we discuss the
merits of a poetical style, we enter
upon a subject on which we must not
expect to reason with strict certainty,
or arrive at very dogmatic conclusions.
To the last some minds will find a glorious
imagination, where others will
perceive only a logical absurdity.
We can only come, as we have said,
to some compromise between reason
and emotion. They meet together in
the arena of imagination, and must
settle their rival claims as they best
can.</p>

<p class='c010'>That Gray was a true poet surely no
one will deny. Who has bequeathed,
in proportion to the extent or volume
of his writings, a greater number of
those individual lines and passages
which live in the memory of all men,
and are recognised as the most perfect
expression of a given thought or sentiment
that our British world has produced?
But such lines and passages
rarely bear the stamp of the poet’s
mannerism. They would not have
gained their universal acceptation if
they had. Highest excellence is all
of one style. That manner which
constitutes the peculiarity of Gray,
and which distinguishes him from other
poets, we certainly do not admire, and
we will give the best reasons for our
dislike to it that we are able.</p>

<p class='c010'>Poetry we have somewhere heard
defined as “passionate rhythmical expression;”
and, if our memory fail us,
and we do not quote correctly, we nevertheless
venture to promulgate this
as a very sufficient definition. It is
passionate rhythmical expression; and
it becomes imaginative because it is
passionate. Every one knows that
strong feeling runs to metaphor and
imagery to express itself; or, in other
words, that a predominant sentiment
will gather round itself a host of kindred
ideas held often together by almost
imperceptible associations. In proportion
as the mind is full of ideas or
remembered objects, will be the complex
structure which will grow out of
this operation. It is not, therefore,
because a strain is complex, ornate,
or full of learning, that it ceases to
be spontaneous or natural. If Milton
rolls out thought after thought,
gathered from the literature of Rome
or Greece, the verse may be quite
as natural, quite as genuine an expression
of sentiment as any ballad
in the <cite>Percy Reliques</cite>. But what is
desired is, that, learned or not, the
strain have this character of spontaneity,
<em>that it be the language in which
some mortal has verily and spontaneously
thought</em>. We do not mean, of
course, that the style should not be
corrected by afterthought, but the
corrections should be made in the
same spirit, the language moving from
the thought and passion of the man.
Now, there is much of Gray’s writing
of which it cannot be said that the
language or imagery flows by any
such spontaneous process; in which
we are perpetually reminded of effort
and artifice, which, as it never <em>came
from</em>, so it can never go home straightway
to any human soul.</p>

<p class='c010'>We might venture even to take for
an instance the popular line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“E’en in our ashes live their wonted fires.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>This quotation has obtained a general
currency: “ashes” and their “fires”
bear each other out so well, that the
careless reader has no doubt the
meaning is all right. Yet we suspect
that very many quote the line without
any distinct meaning whatever attached
to it. And for this reason,—no
Englishman would ever naturally
have expressed the sentiment in this
language. Men, at least some men,
are careful where they shall lay their
bones; they would sleep amongst
their fathers, their countrymen, their
children; some seek a retired spot;
some where friends will congregate;
some choose the sun, and some the
shadow. They endue the dead clay
that will be lying under the turf with
some vague sentiment of feeling—with
some residue of the old affections.
Would any Englishman, impressed
with such a feeling, go back
in imagination to classic times, when
the body was burnt, and speak of
“ashes” which never will exist,
rather than of the slumbering corpse
which his eye must be following, as
he speaks, into the earth? Here is the
whole stanza:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“On some fond breast the parting soul relies,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some pious drops the closing eye requires,</div>
      <div class='line'>E’en from the tomb the voice of nature cries,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>E’en in our ashes live their wonted fires.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is altogether, it will be seen, a very
elaborate structure. Gray was a genuine
lover of nature; yet he would
rather make a patchwork out of
poetical phrases, and the traditional
imagery of the poets, than place himself
in the scene he meant to describe,
and watch in imagination the effects
it would produce upon him. The
critics have remarked that, in the
opening stanzas of the <cite>Elegy</cite>, events
are described as contemporaneous
which must have been successive. We
have sunset in one stanza:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>And in the next, we have advanced
into the perfect moonlight:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The moping owl does to the moon complain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of such as, wandering near her secret bow’r,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Molest her ancient solitary reign.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It may be argued, indeed, that time
does not stand still with the poet;
and that, as he lingered in the churchyard,
twilight had given way to midnight.
But we are afraid that the
true answer is simply this—that the
ivy-mantled tower, the moon, and
the owl, were, at all events, to be introduced
as fit accompaniments of the
scene; and that no question was ever
asked how they would harmonise with
the sunset view of distant fields, that
we had glanced at just before.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hark, how each giant oak, and desert cave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sighs to the torrent’s awful voice beneath!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>That one who loved mountains, and
frequented them, should put a string
of unmeaning words like these into
the mouth of his Welsh bard! There
is absolutely <em>nothing</em> in them. Give
your Welsh harper the finest ear
imaginable, and put him on what
mountain you will, what “desert
caves” will he hear sighing in response
to giant oaks, and these again
to the torrent beneath?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O’er thee, oh King! their hundred arms they wave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breathe.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The oaks waving in wrath “their
hundred arms,” is a fine frenzy
enough; but it is spoilt again by the
“hoarser murmurs breathe,”—words
in which no man ever thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instances of this artificial manner
of building up the rhyme, it would be
superfluous to multiply. Let us rather
drop a hint against carrying our
strictures to an undue degree of severity.
There is, especially, a running
charge of plagiarism brought against
Gray, and all such <em>composite</em> poets,
which is altogether unfair. If they
have formed their style in the study of
other poets, it follows that they must
repeat the phrases of their predecessors;
but, if they do this in the expression
of a new thought of their
own, such use of their language must
not be described as plagiarism. A
critic before us thus comments on
some lines in the <cite>Elegy</cite>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Their furrow oft the <em>stubborn glebe</em> has broke;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How jocund did they drive their <em>team a-field</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>How bent the woods beneath their <em>sturdy stroke</em>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“This stanza is made up of various
pieces inlaid. ‘Stubborn glebe’ is from
Gay; ‘drive a-field’ from Milton;
‘sturdy stroke’ from Spencer.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c008'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Now,
there is not one of these expressions
which does not here fall very properly
into its place; and a writer familiar
with poetic diction would make use
of them without any reference to the
authors from whom they might have
been, in the first place, received. Indeed,
it would be quite impossible for
any one to compose in this <em>mosaic</em>
fashion; nor is there any end to the
charges of plagiarism that might, on
this principle, be brought. If such
expressions as “sturdy stroke,” and
“drive a-field,” are to be traced to the
ownership of some predecessor, one
does not see how one is to move at
all. The language of the country,
like its arable land, is all appropriated.
In the passage here
commented on, the critic needed
not have stopped where he did.
“How jocund,” he might have added,
is from Fletcher, and “how bent the
woods,” from Dryden; and then only
consider if these three lines were
composed after such a fashion, what
a wonderful piece of workmanship
they must be! Whilst we are
as hostile as any to laborious, conscious
artifice, or the mere repetition
of traditional phrases and images, we
must deprecate a species of criticism
which would shut out the poet from
his legitimate resources, deter him
from the careful study of his predecessors,
and either drive him into a
poor, timid, barren style of composition,
or else induce him to seek the
praise of originality by coining new
words and fantastical expressions.</p>

<p class='c010'>We must now address ourselves to
the work before us, <cite>The Correspondence
of Gray and Mason</cite>, as here presented
to us by the careful editorship
of Mr Mitford.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Mitford has by his editorial offices
for ever associated his own name
with that of the poet Gray. In the
Aldine edition of his works he performed
the good office of restoring the
genuine text of Gray’s letters, which
his first biographer, Mason, had so
singularly garbled. For this and other
good services of the same kind the
public were already indebted to Mr
Mitford. He has now, we presume,
completed his labours on this subject
by the publication of <cite>The Correspondence
of Gray and Mason</cite> in the form
Mason himself had preserved it, with
copious notes explanatory of all things
necessary to be known, and some
which, we are happy to think, are not
quite necessary items in the sum of
human knowledge.</p>

<p class='c010'>The publication of this octavo volume
in its separate form was, we
suppose, inevitable. The course of
editorial labours will not run smooth
any more than any other courses. In
due order of things, Mr Mitford, when
he prepared his edition of <cite>Gray’s Letters</cite>
for the press, should have had
the materials which form this volume
put into his hands; he could then
have incorporated in his book such
additions to the letters of Gray as are
to be found here; he could have
avoided reprinting a considerable number
of them, and might have given us
such of the letters of Mason (none
others are of the least value) as throw
light upon the biography and writings
of the poet Gray. But this natural
order of things was not to be permitted.
It was, we must presume, after
the Aldine edition had been printed that
the manuscript of Mason came under
his inspection. Thus this large new
volume was judged indispensable, although
it is manifestly destined to a
very brief existence; and, in spite of
its luxury of type, and its neat livery
of green and gold, must be absorbed,
its personality entirely lost, in the
next and more complete edition of the
works of Gray.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Mason prepared the letters
of his distinguished friend for publication,
he was not sufficiently unreasonable
to thrust many of his
own upon the notice of the reader;
but he took care to preserve carefully
in a manuscript volume the
correspondence of both parties, or
at least such portions of his own
letters as he thought were creditable
to himself. This manuscript
volume he bequeathed to his
friend Mr Stonhewer; from him “it
passed,” Mr Mitford tells us in his
preface, “into the hands of his relative,
Mr Bright of Skeffington Hall,
Leicestershire. When, in the year
1845, the library of Gray was sold
by the sons of that gentleman, then
deceased, this volume of Correspondence
was purchased by Mr Penn of
Stoke Park, and by him was kindly
placed in my hands for publication.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr Mitford has not only judged it
worthy of a separate publication, but
has bestowed the utmost pains in preparing
it for the press. His industrial
annotation strikes us with a sort
of wonder. We are amazed at the
pertinacity of research, all the more
laudable, we presume, because the
prize held forth was of such almost
inappreciable value. “So you have
christened Mr Dayrolles’ child,” says
Mr Gray to the Rev William Mason,
and passes on, regardless, to other
matter—to something pertaining to
the then Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Not so the conscientious editor.
Who is this Mr Dayrolles? and why
has the christening of his child by the
Rev. William Mason been glanced at
by the poet? Forthwith a ransacking
amongst all memoirs; we are referred
to <cite>Chesterfield’s Letters</cite>, Maty’s
edition, and Lord Mahon’s edition, and
<cite>Walpole’s Miscellaneous Letters</cite>; and
at length, in a manuscript memorandum
(so far do we extend our researches),
we find the bit of scandal:
this “Mr Dayrolles’ child” is not the
child of Mr Dayrolles at all, but of
one Mr Stanhope; and to this it was
that, we are told, “Mr Gray silently
pointed.”—P. 129.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not always that we get even
such a result. Sometimes we have a
long list of references, with some
dates and facts, dry as a parish register.
Here is a note on a certain Mr
Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On Mr Cambridge and his habits of
conversation, see ‘Walpole’s Letters to
Lady Ossory,’ vol. i. pp. 132, 140, 410;
vol. ii. p. 242; Walpole to Mason, vol.
i. p. 235; and ‘Nichol’s Literary Illustrations,’
vol. i. p. 130; and ‘Rockingham
Memoirs,’ vol. i. p. 215, for his letter
to Lord Hardwicke, in June 1765.
In conversation he was said to be full of
entertainment, liveliness, and anecdote.
One sarcastic joke on Capability Brown
testifies his wit, and his <cite>Scribleriad</cite> still
survives in the praises of Dr Warton;
yet the radical fault that pervades it is
well shown in <cite>Annual Review</cite>, ii. 584.”—P.
184.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the “one sarcastic joke” we
are not permitted to hear; but we
are kindly told in what volume of
the <cite>Annual Review</cite> we shall find the
“radical fault,” pointed out of a
satire that lives only “in the praises
of Dr Warton.” One more instance
we must select, that our readers may
form some just appreciation of the
indefatigable research of our learned
editor. The name of Sir Richard
Lyttleton being mentioned, we are
invited to the perusal of the following
note:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Richard Lyttleton, K.B. He married
the Lady Rachel Russell, sister of
John Duke of Bedford, and widow of
Scrope Egerton, Duke of Bridgewater.
He was first page of honour to Queen
Caroline; then successively Captain of
Marines, Aide-de-Camp to the Earl of
Stair at the battle of Dettingen, and
Deputy Quartermaster-General in South
Britain, with the rank of Lieut.-Colonel
and Lieut.-General, &#38;c. He was fifth
son of Sir Thomas, fourth baronet and
younger brother of George, First Lord
Lyttleton.—See some letters by him in
‘Chatham Correspondence,’ vol. ii. p. 173,
&#38;c. He was Governor of Minorca in
1764, and subsequently Governor of
Guernsey.—See ‘Walpole’s Misc. Letters,’
iv. pp. 363, 424. He died in 1770.
<em>His house, in the Harley Street corner,
1 Cavendish Square</em>, was bought by the
Princess Emily, and was afterwards Mr
Hope’s, and then Mr Watson Taylor’s.—See
‘Grenville Papers,’ i. pp. 49, 249;
and ii. pp. 442, 449. <em>When in Minorca,
he was involved in some dispute with
Samuel Johnson, who held a situation
under him.</em>—See reference to it in ‘Walpole’s
Letters to Lord Hertford,’ Feb.
6, 1764.”</p>

<p class='c009'>All this, we doubt not, is very
praiseworthy; but where is it to end?
A learned man writing to another
learned man, says, in honest blunt
vernacular, “Have you seen Mr
Thomson?” and passes on to other
matter. Is the heart of an editor to
beat within him till he has discovered
who this Thomson was, and everything
discoverable about him—what
house he lived in, and whom he
quarrelled with? This Thomson is
mentioned only once, and we have
nothing of him but his name. The
more mysterious, seems the indefatigable
editor to think; and the more
meritorious, if from so slight a clue
he can succeed in identifying this
defunct Thomson. Whereupon a
ransacking of all libraries and innumerable
references,—see this, see
that! see, see! We wonder if there
is any one man in Great Britain,
not an editor, so laboriously idle as
to climb the steps of a library to
<em>see</em> after all these surprising discoveries.</p>

<p class='c010'>Books, it seems, are used by different
persons for very different purposes.
Some build up theories of all
sorts with them; children take them
out of the book-case, and build
houses and castles with them, perhaps
almost as substantial; the good
monks in one of the monasteries of the
Levant, Mr Curzon tells us, used
them as mats, or cushions, to protect
their bare feet from the cold pavement
of the chapel; and others,
again, pull them about, and toss over
the leaves with restless agitation—to
find who Mr Thomson was! Of
the two last, we infinitely prefer the
quiet serviceable employment of them
by the monks whom Mr Curzon
visited.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a pleasure in poetic
pains”—there must be a charm in
labour editorial that only editors can
know. There is withal, it seems, a
gravity of duty, a weight of responsibility,
which they only can duly appreciate.
We are happy to hear, that
in proportion to the dulness is the
virtue of their labours. “To give
some personality,” says our present
editor in his preface, “<em>to names, most
of them new, even to those who are acquainted
with the common biographies
of Gray</em>, has been found, from the
lapse of time, a matter of some difficulty;
and success has only been
attained by the assistance of various
friends. To have passed over this
part of the task would have been unsatisfactory,
and considered <em>a dereliction
of duty</em>!” It is added, with a
little inconsistency, that the persons
whose names are here heard for the
first time, “formed the select and
intimate society of one who was not
remarkable for the facility with which
his acquaintance was gained.” What
intimate friend have we here added
to the well-known list? But let us
grant that the mantle of the poet ennobles
all it touches, does the Reverend
William Mason also rank among the
inspired?—for we find that his letters
are edited with the same reverential
care.</p>

<p class='c010'>We shall be answered, that if we do
not think highly of the immortal author
of <cite>Elfrida</cite>, and <cite>Caractacus</cite>, and
<cite>The English Garden</cite>, others do. Mr
Mitford does. “The place in his library
was pointed out to me,” he pathetically
tells us, “where Mason
usually sate and wrote. <em>His poetical
chair</em>—sedes beata—<em>was kindly bequeathed
to me; and I have left it by
will to the Poet Laureate of the day,
that it may rest amongst the sacred
brotherhood!</em>” What an announcement
for Mr Tennyson to read! What
will he do with the chair when it
comes? A superstitious man would
hardly venture to sit in it. Who
knows what spirit of drowsiness may
be still clinging about it?</p>

<p class='c010'>If we have been provoked into any
impatient remarks on this excess of
editorship, we would at the same
time express—as we feel—an undiminished
respect for Mr Mitford. He is
a literary veteran who has performed
many a good service. We would
rather retract every word, and beg
that every expression be set down to
mere petulance on our part, than be
thought wanting in personal respect
to one who has well earned his reputable
position in the world of letters.
But we cannot help ourselves; we
must “tell the tale,” as the tale tells
itself to us.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the few additions made in the
present volume to the letters of Gray,
those which congratulate Mason on
his clerical promotion, and on his marriage,
are amongst the most sprightly
and entertaining. The following extracts
may be new to our readers:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mason</span>,—It is a mercy that old
men are mortal, and that dignified clergymen
know how to keep their word. I
heartily rejoice with you in your establishment,
and with myself that I have
lived to see it—to see your insatiable
mouth stopped, and your anxious periwig
at rest and slumbering in a stall. The
Bishop of London, you see, is dead; there
is a fine opening. Is there nothing further
to tempt you? Feel your own pulse,
and answer me seriously. It rains precentorships;
you have only to hold up
your skirts to catch them.”&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Doctor</span>,—I send your reverence
the lesson, &#38;c. No sooner do people feel
their income increase than they want
amusement. Why, what need have you
of any other than to sit like a Japanese
divinity, with your hands folded on your
fat belly, wrapped, and, as it were, annihilated
in the contemplation of your own
<em>copuses</em> and revenues?”</p>

<p class='c009'>His felicitations upon his friend’s
marriage are not always distinguished
for their delicacy. With full allowance
for the difference of the times,
we still encounter a certain coarseness
we should not have expected in the
fastidious Gray. But the following
is a very charming letter:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mason</span>,—<i><span lang="la">Res est sacra miser</span></i>
(says the poet), but I say it is the happy
man that is the sacred thing, and therefore
let the profane keep their distance.
He is one of Lucretius’ gods, supremely
blest in the contemplation of his own felicity,
and what has he to do with worshippers?
This, mind, is the first reason why
I did not come to York; the second is,
that I do not love confinement, and probably
by next summer may be permitted
to touch whom, and where, and with what
I think fit, without giving you any offence;
the third and last, and not the least perhaps,
is, that the finances were at so low
an ebb that I could not exactly do what
I wished, but was obliged to come the
shortest road to town and recruit them.
I do not justly know what your taste in
reasons may be since you altered your
condition, but there is the ingenious, the
petulant, and the dull; any one would
have done, for in my conscience I do not
believe you care a halfpenny for reasons
at present: so God bless ye both, and give
ye all ye wish, when ye are restored to
the use of your wishes.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am returned from Scotland charmed
with my expedition: it is of the Highlands
I speak; the Lowlands are worth
seeing once, but the mountains are ecstatic,
and ought to be visited in pilgrimage
once a-year. None but those monstrous
creatures of God know how to join so
much beauty with so much horror. A
fig for your poets, painters, gardeners,
and clergymen, that have not been among
them; their imagination can be made up
of nothing but bowling-greens, flowering
shrubs, horse-ponds, Fleet-ditches, shell
grottoes, and Chinese rails. Then I had
so beautiful an autumn—Italy could
hardly produce a nobler scene—and this
so sweetly contrasted with the perfection
of nastiness, and total want of accommodation,
that Scotland only can supply!
Oh, you would have blessed yourself! I
shall certainly go again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mason</span>,—I rejoice; but has
she common sense? Is she a gentlewoman?
Has she money? Has she a
nose? I know she sings a little, and
twiddles on the harpsichord, hammers at
sentiment, and puts herself in an attitude,
admires a cast in the eye, and can say
<cite>Elfrida</cite> by heart. But these are only the
virtues of a maid. Do let her have some
wife-like qualities, and a double portion
of prudence, as she will have not only
herself to govern but you also, and that
with an absolute sway. Your friends, I
doubt not, will suffer for it. However,
we are very happy, and have no other
wish than to see you settled in the world.
We beg you would not stand fiddling
about it, but be married forthwith.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is impossible, and indeed would
be doing injustice to the editor, to
regard this present volume in any
other light than as a supplement to
his edition of the Works of Gray. We
must beg leave, therefore, to revert
briefly to the life and letters as they
are set forth in this preceding publication.
It so happens that Mr Mitford
was not fortunate even here in the
order and method in which his materials
reached him, and were consequently
arranged. Fresh accessions
came in at the latest hour; a fifth
volume was to be added, in which
there was much repetition; whole
letters being reprinted that had already
appeared in their place in the previous
volumes. Sometimes also an interesting
fact is slipped into an appendix,
where it may chance to have escaped
the eye of all but very attentive
readers.</p>

<p class='c010'>One such fact arrested our own
attention, and is a fact of great significance.
To some of our readers we
may be rendering a welcome service
by bringing it forward. We are
referred to Sir Egerton Brydges as
the authority for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Few lives, even of literary men,
are said to have been more devoid of
incident than Gray’s; yet it is probable
that, if we could lift the curtain
from his domestic life during the
period of his youth, we should find
that it was disturbed enough, and of
such a nature as must have left deep
traces in the subsequent character of
the man. Gray, it will be remembered,
was (to adopt the language of
Horace Walpole) “the son of a money
scrivener by Mary Antrobus, a milliner
in Cornhill, and sister to two
Antrobus’s who were ushers of Eton
School. He was born in 1716, and
educated at Eton College, chiefly
under the direction of one of his uncles,
who took prodigious pains with him,
which answered exceedingly. From
Eton he went to Peter House at
Cambridge,” &#38;c. &#38;c. So in all biographies
glides on the simple account
of his career. Nothing is said of that
home in Cornhill, or wherever it was
in the City.</p>

<p class='c010'>But now, some years ago, at a sale
of books belonging to one Isaac Reid,
there was purchased a manuscript
volume of law cases, written out very
probably by some studious pupil, for
his future behoof and instruction.
Amongst these law cases was one
drawn up by the mother of Gray, or
by some one on her part, and laid
formally before counsel for his opinion.
It reveals in its one solitary statement
the history of years; it tells of domestic
discord of the harshest character,
and this brought on and imbittered by
pecuniary difficulties. Whilst young
Gray was studying at Peter House,
Cambridge, his mother was drawing
up the following case for the opinion
of counsel.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Case.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>“Philip Gray, before his marriage with
his wife (then Dorothy Antrobus, and
who was then partner with her sister
Mary Antrobus), entered into certain
articles of agreement”—(permitting, in
short, the said Dorothy Antrobus to continue
the said partnership for her own
sole and separate use.)</p>

<p class='c017'>“That in pursuance of the said articles,
the said Mary, with the assistance of the
said Dorothy her sister, hath carried on
the said trade for near thirty years, with
tolerable success for the said Dorothy.
That she hath been at no charge to the
said Philip; and during all the said time
hath not only found herself in all manner
of apparel, but also for all her children to
the number of twelve, and most of the
furniture of his house; and paying £40
a-year for his shop, <em>almost providing
everything for her son, whilst at Eton
school, and now he is at Peter House at
Cambridge</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Notwithstanding which, <em>almost ever
since he hath been married</em>, he hath used
her in the most inhuman manner, by
beating, kicking, pinching, and with the
most vile and abusive language; that she
hath been in the utmost fear, and danger
of her life, and hath been obliged this
last year to quit her bed and lie with her
sister. <em>This she was resolved, if possible,
to bear; not to leave her shop of trade for
the sake of her son, to be able to assist in
the maintenance of him at the University,
since his father won’t.</em></p>

<p class='c017'>“There is no cause for this usage unless
it be an unhappy jealousy of all mankind
in general (her own brother not excepted);
but no woman deserves or hath
maintained a more virtuous character:
or it is presumed, if he can make her sister
leave off trade, he thinks he can then
come into his wife’s money, but the
articles are too secure for his vile purposes.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He daily threatens he will pursue her
with all the vengeance possible, and <em>will
ruin himself to undo her and his only son</em>;
in order to which he hath given warning
to her sister to quit his shop where they
have carried on their trade so successfully,
which will be almost their ruin: but he
insists she shall go out at Midsummer
next; and the said Dorothy, his wife,
in necessity must be forced to go along
with her to some other house and shop,
<em>to be assisting to her said sister in the said
trade, for her own and her son’s support</em>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But if she can be quiet, she neither
expects nor desires any help from him:
but he is really so very vile in his nature,
she hath all the reason to expect most
troublesome usage from him that can be
thought of.”—Vol. i. Appendix B.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then follow some questions, and the
answer of Counsel, which it is not
necessary to extract. What must
have been the effect of such domestic
scenes as are here disclosed to us, on
the sensitive mind of Gray, may be
partly guessed. Nor need we be surprised
that the college youth at Peter
House, and the associate of Horace
Walpole, early contracted a habit of
silence upon the events of his own
life. Bonstettin, whom he took so
cordially to his friendship, says, “<span lang="fr">Je
racontais à Gray ma vie et mon pays,
mais toute sa vie à lui était fermée
pour moi. <em>Jamais il ne me parlait de
lui.</em> Il y avait chez Gray entre le present
et le passé un abîme infranchisable.
Quand je voulais un approche,
de sombre nuées venaient le couvrir.</span>”—Vol.
<span class='fss'>V.</span>, Notes, p. 181.</p>

<p class='c010'>We understand now why Gray held
his mother in so much esteem, and
why the father was rarely spoken of,
while her name was never mentioned
to the latest day without a trembling
of the voice; why there was found at
his death, still unopened, in his room,
the chest containing her wearing-apparel:
he had never dared to open
it, or had never reconciled himself to
part with its contents. To his mother
he owed his education and the position
he occupied in life—a greater debt
than even that life which she twice
gave. He was the only one of twelve
children who survived. The rest died
in their infancy, as we are told, “from
suffocation produced by a fulness of
blood;” and this strange family destiny
would have befallen Gray also,
but that his mother “removed the
paroxysm which attacked him, by
opening a vein with her own hand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The chief incident of Gray’s life, so
far as biographers have been able to
record it, is his intimacy with Walpole;—his
journey with him upon the Continent,
and the rupture that took
place between them. Of this quarrel
we find an explanation in a note which
is by no means honourable to Walpole.
Entertaining a suspicion that Gray
had spoken ill of him to some friends
in England, he clandestinely opened
and re-sealed one of Gray’s letters.
After this, there was “little cordiality
between them.” We should think
not, for, short of a crime, could one
man be guilty towards another of a
more dishonourable action? But we
are not satisfied with the authority on
which this explanation is given. The
account will be found in a note, vol. ii.
p. 175. We have only that sort of
hearsay evidence which lawyers have
universally agreed in rejecting. A
Mr Isaac Reed makes a private memorandum
(some time after the conversation)
of what a Mr Roberts, of the
Pell office, had told him. This is not
sufficient authority for what, we presume
in the time of Walpole as well
as our own, would be regarded as a
grave charge, if brought against a
gentleman. Of Mr Roberts, of the
Pell office, and how he heard the
story, we are told nothing. Mr Isaac
Reed merely says of him “that he
was likely to be well informed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The quarrel, its cause and its reconciliation,
are, perhaps, now of
very little moment, but the intimacy
with Walpole must always remain as
one of the most important facts in the
life of Gray. For what is the character
which Gray reveals to us? In
few words, it is the incongruous combination
of the sensitive poet and
man of letters, with the affectation
and levity of a man of the world.
This latter phase of his character
must have owed much of its development
to his early intercourse with
the son of a prime-minister, and one
whose wit and pleasantry would fully
justify and explain an influence over
his graver companion. Gray was a
man who had a heart, and had learnt
to hide it under the affectation of
indifference; neither could he have
been without the stirrings of a noble
ambition; but he had taught himself
that it was a prettier thing to graft
the man of letters on the refined
gentleman, than to give himself, heart
and soul, to some intellectual enterprise.
He thinks, or he can write,
that “Literature, to take it in its
most comprehensive sense, and include
everything that requires invention
or judgment, or barely application
and industry, seems indeed drawing
apace to its dissolution;” but he
makes no serious effort to arrest this
dissolution. What is the literature
of a country but the efforts of such
men as he? There was a younger
contemporary, one Gibbon, then
turning over the same classic pages
as himself, who was soon to add to
the literature of England a History
which would display more learning
and more eloquence than had ever before
been united together. Antiquarian
as he was, what epoch has he illustrated
for us? Zoologist, botanist; he
corrects the latinity of Linnæus! He
makes notes innumerable—notes on
Strabo, notes on Plato; the text of
what author has he amended or
explained for us? When appointed
Professor of History, he does not even
write a single lecture.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The political opinions of Gray,
H. Walpole says, he never rightly
understood;” and his biographer adds
that his religious opinions lie in a certain
obscurity. Some writers “not
favourable to the cause of Christianity,”
have ranked him, it seems,
amongst freethinkers: orthodox and
pious friends have no doubt whatever
about his orthodoxy or his piety.
The perusal of his Letters never led
us, for a moment, to rank him
amongst unbelievers; but if any one
should suggest that he had not thought
on the subject with sufficient earnestness
even to be a doubter, we might
be disposed to acquiesce in this explanation.
He lived in a time when
there was little earnestness of thought,
and he was not of that energetic nature
which rises above the influence
of the age. He was scandalised at
Rousseau and Voltaire because they
were disturbers of the peace: one is
not sure that there was a deeper
feeling in his hostility towards them.
The manner in which a person is
<em>written to</em> is often as significant as
the manner in which he himself
writes. Throughout their correspondence,
the Rev. William Mason never
alludes to his clerical profession in
any one respect but as a means of living
well and comfortably in the world—as
a career in which promotion and
good living are to be encountered.
The credit of this quite secular tone
must be divided between the correspondents:
perhaps in the greater
measure to the elder and more influential
of the two.</p>

<p class='c010'>These correspondents were, no
doubt, excellent friends; but Gray
never speaks to a third person in a
very flattering manner of Mason. He
is disposed always to deny any very
close intimacy. He appears to have
said to himself, Men will laugh at us
two poets, communing upon verse,
and flattering each other <em>upon the
muse</em>; they will make me out also no
better than a poet; whereas I am
gentleman by profession and poet by
accident. Writing to Walpole, he
says, “I like Mr Aston Hervey’s
Fable, and an ode by Mr Mason, a
new acquaintance of mine.” Of this
new acquaintance he had written to
Warton, more than two years before,
in the following strain: “Mr
Mason is my acquaintance; I liked
that ode very much, but have found
no one else that did. He has much
fancy, little judgment, and a good
deal of modesty. I take him for a
good and well-meaning creature; but
then he is really in simplicity a child,
and loves everybody he meets with;
he reads little or nothing, writes
abundance, and that with a design to
make his fortune by it.” In another
place he says of him that he “has not,
properly speaking, anything one can
call a passion about him, except a
little malice and revenge.” Such
phrases as these occur in his correspondence
with Warton and Brown:
“I do not hear from Mason;” “You
think us great correspondents, but,”
&#38;c. To us it seems that he really
liked the younger poet, who more,
perhaps, than any other man he
knew, sympathised with him on the
poetical side of his character; but
then he did not like to be grouped
with him, in the eyes of the wits and
the worldlings. They will compare
us, and associate us, and think us
rival candidates for popular applause.</p>

<p class='c010'>We see this morbid sense of ridicule
betray itself in his publication of his
poems. He insists upon it that the
poems shall be published as mere
illustrations of the drawings of
Bentley, which accompanied them.
The book met with applause, and the
<cite>Elegy</cite> became at once a popular favourite.
He seems, in a letter to
Warton, to reprove and to repudiate
this abundant praise. “I should
have been glad that you and two or
three more people had liked them,
which would have satisfied my ambition
on this head amply.” For all
this, when he published the <cite>Bard</cite>, and
other odes which, from their nature,
appealed still more to the select few,
he was not a little nettled because
“the town” found them obscure.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his manner and carriage, Gray
is described as being cold and fastidious
to an offensive degree. A contemporary
and admirer, Rev. William
Cole, says, “I am apt to think the
characters of Voltaire and Mr Gray
were similar. They were both little
men, very nice and exact in their
persons and dress, most lively and
agreeable in conversation, except
that Mr Gray was apt to be too satirical,
and both of them full of affectation.”
And then contrasting him
with Dr Farmer, he thus describes the
two men: “The one (Dr Farmer)
a cheerful, companionable, hearty,
open, downright man, of no great regard
to dress or common forms of
behaviour; the other (Gray) of a
most fastidious and recluse distance of
carriage, rather averse to sociability,
but of the graver turn; nice, and elegant
in his person, dress, and behaviour,
even to a degree of finicalness
and effeminacy.”—Vol. i., Appendix.
The contrast here drawn between
Gray and Dr Farmer, suggests to us
the dissimilarity and mutual distaste
which existed between Gray and a
still greater contemporary, Dr Johnson.
They repelled each other far
more by diversity of manner than by
opposition of opinion. Gray refused
to be personally acquainted with
Johnson. Passing him in the streets
of London, he whispered to the companion
with whom he was walking,
“There is the Great Bear! there goes
Ursa Major!” and accompanied the
words with a sort of shrinking and recoil.
It is well known that the antipathy
was mutual. The judgment
passed upon Gray in the <cite>Lives of the
Poets</cite> is the harshest and the least
equitable criticism throughout that
work. One cannot help admitting,
however, that, if Gray had written
the life of Johnson, there would have
been a piece of criticism produced still
less equitable. Gray is rarely just to
any of his contemporaries. He seldom
admires, and the little praise he
bestows is distributed most capriciously.
He speaks as highly of
Lyttleton’s Monody as of the Odes of
Collins. He mentions Sterne but
coldly, and when he would be complimentary,
always selects his <cite>Sermons</cite>!
You would say that a certain
superciliousness has been creeping over
and into the very heart of the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>But now change the point of view,
and from this the world-aspect turn
to the poetic side of the character. It
was not a heartless man who wrote
the <cite>Elegy</cite> and the <cite>Bard</cite>, who was the
friend of West, who in later times
was the friend of Bonstettin, who at
all times could find society in meditation,
and companionship in beauties
of nature. The Letters of Gray are
too well known to render it necessary
for us to make extracts from them, to
show how often a vein of deep feeling
runs through a half-playful style of
diction. His pathos touches us still
more, whether he is describing nature,
or speaking of himself and of his
friends, from the restraint he has evidently
put upon his own enthusiasm,
or his own tenderness. The “melancholy
Gray” was a far higher being
than the witty and Walpolian Gray;
and it is the blending of the two together
that has made the singular
charm of the Letters.</p>

<p class='c010'>If evidence were wanted to prove
that there existed uncorrupted in the
mind of Gray springs of pure and
genuine feeling, we should find that
evidence in his attachment to Bonstettin.
This young foreigner, by
his own ardent temper, had broken
down all those cold artificial barriers
in which it is said the poet habitually
intrenched himself. Gray had taken
lodgings for him at Cambridge, near
his own rooms, and they spent the
evenings together, reading the Greek
poets and philosophers. When Bonstettin
returned to his native country,
Switzerland, Gray felt the loss of his
friend in a manner which he does not
seek even to disguise, but expresses
with unaffected warmth:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>Cambridge, April 12, 1770.</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Never did I feel, my dear Bonstettin,
to what a tedious length the few short
moments of our life may be extended by
impatience and expectation, till you had
left me: nor ever knew before with so
strong a conviction how much this frail
body sympathises with the inquietude of
the mind. I am grown old in the compass
of less than three weeks, like the
Sultan in the Turkish tales, that did but
plunge his head into a vessel of water,
and take it out again, as the standers-by
affirmed, at the command of a Dervise,
and found he had passed many years in
captivity, and begot a large family of
children. The strength and spirits that
now enable me to write to you are only
owing to your last letter, a temporary
gleam of sunshine. Heaven knows when
it may shine again. I did not conceive
till now, I own, what it was to lose you,
nor felt the solitude and insipidity of my
own condition before I possessed the happiness
of your friendship.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But enough of this—I return to your letter.
It proves at least that, in the midst
of your new gaieties, I still hold some
place in your memory; and, what pleases
me above all, it has an air of undissembled
sincerity. Go on, my best and amiable
friend, to show me your heart simply,
and without the shadow of disguise, and
leave me to weep over it, as I now do, no
matter whether from joy or sorrow.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Alas! how do I every moment feel the
truth of what I have somewhere read,
‘Ce n’est pas le voir, que de s’en souvenir’;
and yet that remembrance is the
only satisfaction I have left. My life now
is but a conversation with your shadow—the
known sound of your voice still
rings in my ears—there, on the corner of
the fender, you are standing, or tinkling
on the pianoforte, or stretched at length
on the sofa. Do you reflect, my dearest
friend, that it is a week or eight days
before I can receive a letter from you,
and as much more before you can have
my answer; and that all that time I am
employed, with more than Herculean
toil, in pushing the tedious hours along,
and wishing to annihilate them: the more
I strive, the heavier they move, and the
longer they grow. I cannot bear this
place, where I have spent many tedious
years, within less than a month since you
left me. I am going for a few days to
see poor Nicholls,” &#38;c., &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am returned, my dear Bonstettin,
from the little journey I made into Suffolk,
without answering the end proposed.
The thought that you might have been
with me there, has imbittered all my
hours. Your letter has made me happy,
as happy as so gloomy, so solitary a being
as I am, is capable of being made. I
know, and have too often felt, the disadvantages
I lay myself under; how much
I hurt the little interest I have in you, by
this air of sadness, so contrary to your
nature and present enjoyments; but sure
you will forgive, though you cannot sympathise
with me. It is impossible for me
to dissemble with you: such as I am I
expose my heart to your view, nor wish
to conceal a single thought from your
penetrating eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These are not the letters of a youth;
they are the outpourings of the mature
man. How grossly do we err indeed
when we think that youth is the especial
or exclusive season of friendship,
or even of love. In the experience
of many it has been found that the
want of the heart, the thirst for affection,
has been felt far more in manhood
than in youth. It was so, perhaps,
with Gray. We are not disposed
to think that there was any peculiar
merit in Bonstettin to justify this
overflow of sentiment. But the heart
of the man was full, and his was the
hand that shook the mantling cup till
it ran over.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have already quoted a part of a
brief account which Bonstettin gives
of Gray—that account proceeds thus:
“<span lang="fr">Je crois que Gray n’avait jamais
aimé,—c’était le mot de l’énigme.
Gray avait de la gaieté dans l’esprit,
et de la mélancolie dans le caractère.
Mais cette mélancolie n’est qu’un besoin
non satisfait de la sensibilité.</span>”
That Gray had never loved, is an explanation
which would better suit the
novelist than the more sedate biographer.
Nevertheless, M. Bonstettin
gives us something to reflect upon.
It is well said that Gray had gaiety
in his mind, but sadness at his heart;
and who can tell how far that sadness
was due to repressed or unoccupied
affection?</p>

<p class='c010'>We had intended to offer to our
readers some rather copious extracts
from Gray’s Letters, to illustrate the
several phases of his character; but
space would be wanting, and perhaps,
the Letters being sufficiently
known, this labour would be needless.
Unfortunately, a few brief detached
extracts would not serve our purpose.
We cannot help remarking, indeed,
the false impression often created by
just such partial extracts. A sentence
which itself is the product only
of a momentary feeling, and which is
neutralised, perhaps, in the very next
page, is made to express a permanent
sentiment of the writer. “Be it
mine,” says Gray at one moment,
“to read eternal new romances of
Marivaux and Crébillon;” and this
quotation has been so often repeated,
that a person who had not read the
Letters might imagine that Gray was
a most exemplary reader of novels.
How very different a kind of reading
occupied his hours we need not say.
He was apt, indeed, to represent himself
as an idler, but there was something
of affectation in this—an affectation
not unfrequent amongst literary
men, who represent themselves as
more indolent than they are, because
they know people will be expecting
some ostensible result of their industry,
or because they desire this result
to wear the appearance of an easy
and a rapid performance. The much
marvelling Mr Mason, with his round
open eyes that see nothing, he too
has his manner of quotation. “‘To
be employed is to be happy,’ said
Gray; and if he had never said anything
else, either in prose or in verse,
he would have deserved the esteem
of all posterity!” So a discovery as
old as Solomon, as old as man, is assigned
to Mr Gray! Yet if a grateful
posterity should turn to the very letter
from which this quotation is made,
they would find that Gray was not
the most energetic nor the most complete
preacher on his own text. He
felt, as every one not a savage or an
idiot must feel, that employment was
an imperative necessity; but he often
seems driven to the expedient of finding
employment for the sake of employment.
Now if he had devoted
himself to some one literary task, of
more or less utility to the world, and
wrought steadily for its accomplishment,
he would have carried his philosophy
and his happiness one step
farther. Next to living solitary, the
great error of his career was that
he had not adopted, either as poet
or historian, some large and useful
task.</p>

Mr Stansfield’s answers, the subsequent explanation of them, we should not have used
such an expression as that he “confessed an astonishing indifference.” We therefore
quote his explanation. He is asked, (<em>Question</em> 3628,) “You have stated that you
have not studied these pictures in the National Gallery much; that you were not
very conversant with the works of the old masters; and that you had not studied
those pictures in particular; so you, from your previous knowledge of them, feel
competent to give an opinion whether or not they have been injured in the minute
details to which reference has been made? Yes. I think I may; because when I
spoke of my ignorance, I did it in reference to my not possessing the information that
I know many gentlemen belonging to the Academy have. I should refer to Mr Dyce
at once as a very great authority, and also to Sir Charles Eastlake himself. I have
not their experience in Italian works of art, but still the pictures that are before us
I have looked at with admiration, and I know that if there is any material injury
done to them I should detect it as soon as any one.”</p>
